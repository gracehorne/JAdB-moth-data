1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Annapena Triangulana, the only known host record was feeding on leaf litter underneath willow tree.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,300
And I had a willow in my yard that I had to have removed because it was damaging my roof.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,820
Ah, so that might be why it looks like it's declining.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:29,860
And I think I only got one or two this year, but the numbers, there was a brief period where it was pretty big numbers.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,240
And Art brought in some that he found, he said, swarming around ivy, which makes no sense.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,560
But unless they feed on leaf litter, because I don't think they're feeding on the live plants.

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,060
But if they're feeding on litter, there's a lot of leaf litter under ivy.

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,000
So do you know what year you had your willow tree removed? Do you remember?

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,060
What year they had the big numbers? You could look in the...

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,560
Well, what, when you had your willow tree removed?

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,520
Uh...

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I don't remember, but it was...

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,520
I could look it up. I could tell you that because I had the roof...

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Because I'm wondering if that's what happened here.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,220
Could be.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:33,960
Anstanoptelia marmorodacta is a terrafora that feeds on mints, various mints.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:50,580
So it has remained kind of consistently present in my yard, but the numbers may vary according to how many herbs are growing in the yard.

18
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
In recent years, I grow...

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:01,140
I have some rosemary that's permanent, but I grow basil every year, and that's about the only one.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,880
And whether the moth's feeding on it or not, I can't say.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,120
And what the neighbors are growing, I can't tell you.

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,420
Did this...

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,760
Do you think that this is real, that you didn't see it in the first, like, five years or so?

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,460
I think it's probably real.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,440
Terraforas are not strongly attracted to light in general.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,760
At least that's kind of the anecdotal information I have on the...

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,560
Aproima, this black one.

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,860
Powell told me that this was another form of the one that I put a name on.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,660
The name of which...

30
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,100
It's the name I'm using for the Cold Canyon one.

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,620
But I think it's a different species.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,920
This is anapronina.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,280
A-P-R-O-A-E.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
So you think that...

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,960
So this is anapronina nigrella nigrella?

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,580
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah, Jerry suggested that this is another form of nigrella.

38
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:24,020
But there's one that looks like it, like this one, that goes under a different name on the Moth Photographers Group worksite.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,780
And it could be that they're both feed on the same food plant.

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,040
And that he reared both from larvae collected on the same food plant.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,260
The food plant is what used to be called Lotus scoperia, but the name is not the same anymore.

42
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,060
It's no longer in lotus and may not be scoperia anymore either, but, you know.

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,460
So do you think that these are distinct species still?

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:56,440
I don't think they're the same species anymore, because I only get the one farm in Davis, and I rarely get the black ones at Cold Canyon.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,220
Right, okay.

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:06,540
I mean, it could be just a different genetics, but, you know, I don't know.

47
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,860
It looks like they're declining here, and those species are declining in Cold Canyon, so...

48
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,880
Well, at Cold Canyon, because it's lotus, and because that's one that probably burned up in the fire.

49
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,480
That's some stuff we need to know.

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,020
Yeah.

51
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,020
I think fire is...

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Fire and weediness at Cold Canyon, although lotus scoperia is a weedy plant, so...

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:44,220
Arkeps Argarapha is the fruit tree leaf roller, and it may be increasing because I replaced an exotic ash tree with a pluot tree.

54
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,280
Hmm.

55
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,380
But my neighbor always had a plum tree.

56
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,540
Another neighbor had an apricot, which he removed, so...

57
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,860
So, stones root's been around.

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,260
It's always around.

59
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,420
But Arkeps Argarapha, it's always associated with oaks.

60
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,800
You find it in the wild near oaks, and it feeds on oak as well.

61
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:15,000
So, it's polyphagous, but because it feeds on fruit trees, it's got its common name associated with fruit trees.

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,660
But that could be why it's increased in my yard.

63
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:28,000
And it tends to come to light a little bit later than, say, Klepsis and some of the other torcheses.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,680
So, I would think that if it were...

65
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't stay up as late as I did when I was younger, so I would think that if it was declining...

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
That would be because of that?

67
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,060
You know, we would attribute it to turning in earlier, but it's doing just the opposite.

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
I've been getting more and more in recent years.

69
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,900
So, I think this is real.

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,520
Okay.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,620
But I don't have oaks in my yard, so it's kind of odd that I have it.

72
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
Maybe they travel further.

73
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:09,660
But it doesn't feed on low-growing plants as much as some of the other torcheses.

74
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:19,600
So, Aristotelia fungiferella, I assume, feeds on some kind of fungus, but I don't know that for certain.

75
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,400
I don't know much about this life history.

76
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,720
I had this one called an Aristotelia species one, I think, for a while.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,120
But it's a dead set match for one on Moth Photographers Group.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,620
So, I think this name is probably correct, but I don't know about it.

79
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,760
Aristotelia species two looks like some of the others.

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,200
And I'll tell you which ones I think are all confused with one another.

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,380
And I'm certain that this is probably two or more species.

82
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,180
Species two.

83
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:57,560
And there are quite a few Aristotelia, which I did not record anywhere.

84
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,180
The ones that are distinct have been recorded consistently.

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,960
And those are ones that I put a name on, for the most part.

86
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,320
Species three looks like two.

87
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,400
Species four looks a little bit like two.

88
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:28,120
So, Aspila molesta is the oriental fruit model.

89
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,600
An introduced species, a pest of fruit trees.

90
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,680
It's a tiny tortoise, smaller, much smaller than most of the others.

91
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,680
But it seemed to enjoy some good years and not so much recently.

92
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:56,040
I think it and Prunivora is another small moth.

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,220
This is a native one.

94
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Seem to be in decline.

95
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,200
They've had a few good years.

96
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:13,440
It's about the same time that the, what was the one we were talking about earlier?

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,580
The one in leaf litter.

98
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,540
Oh.

99
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:17,600
Oh.

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,040
Yeah.

101
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,660
I can't remember things for 10 minutes.

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,340
Me neither.

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,700
Too much in the brain.

104
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:44,100
I'm wondering, Grace, if you could make a note that maybe we could add a non-linear year predictor

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,780
just to capture the species that are having parabolic responses.

106
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:56,440
Yeah, I think it would be interesting to look at ones which coincidentally show similar patterns.

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,140
And boom years and bust years.

108
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
Because our model doesn't account for that, right?

109
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,220
Yeah.

110
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:16,440
Well, there is a possibility because certain parasitoids focus on species that have similar feeding niches.

111
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,060
And they'll be like this.

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,620
Yeah.

113
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,120
Oscillate with the parasitoids.

114
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:31,140
There may be a parasite that feeds on things that make a feeding shelter similar to that of those two species.

115
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,420
I think the leaf litter moth was Annapena triangu.

116
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,360
That's the one, yeah.

117
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:47,780
Okay, we are at, okay, I talked about these last two at the same time pretty much.

118
00:09:48,820 --> 00:10:06,300
Autographia californica, this is, it's somewhat of a pest species and feeds on an array of plants.

119
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,460
You get a lot of them early and a lot of them late and then sporadically in the middle of the year.

120
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,560
And it seems to have very good years once in a while.

121
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,160
I think the year before, last year was pretty good for it.

122
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
Yep, it looks like it was.

123
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,220
Oh, well, we don't have the data from last year, right?

124
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,520
Bactra veritana feeds on sedges.

125
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,480
So that's a weird host plant.

126
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:43,400
And one year, I guess it was last year or maybe the year before, it really showed extreme numbers.

127
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,300
And then it's down again this year.

128
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,160
But it has shown up somewhat consistently all along.

129
00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:02,560
The gissara buxia seemed to be, my recollection was it was somewhat abundant in the early years

130
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,580
and much less so in recent years.

131
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,440
I haven't been getting it anywhere near the numbers that I used to get it.

132
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,140
Okay, so true decline on that one, probably.

133
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,240
Bedelia somnula telefeeds on plants in the Morning Glory family.

134
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,460
And I've kind of given up trying to keep Morning Glory out of my yard, so that may account for.

135
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,460
But also, it's common in the cold months.

136
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:43,080
So, because I didn't collect in the cold months as often, partly because I didn't and partly because I couldn't,

137
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,860
because there was more rain in the past, that could explain some of this recent abundance.

138
00:11:49,860 --> 00:12:04,140
Blastobasis glandulella, some of these may have been recorded as blastobasine species unidentified.

139
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,320
These I separated out because they're bigger and considerably bigger than all the other blastobases.

140
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,880
And there seems to be two forms.

141
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:23,280
So, this could, might be two different species, but the pictures online show two different, the same two different phenotypes.

142
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,180
Borchocenia nephrax.

143
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,600
I only think I have a couple of records for this one.

144
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm surprised this is here.

145
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,040
Oh, that's when I get more common earlier in the year, though.

146
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:51,100
So, that may be why you saw a big spike last year, if that is last year or the year before last.

147
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah, I think it goes up to 2023.

148
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,120
Bucoletrics Albertiola feeds on live oaks, I think.

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,260
And it may also feed on other oaks, but certainly live oaks.

150
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:24,340
Bucoletrics is a tiny moth, and they tend to show up in big numbers during a, when the weather's kind of extreme, either real hot or kind of cold.

151
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,660
It looks like he's been recording this.

152
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,880
You're looking, I think you're looking at the other.

153
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,900
I am, yeah.

154
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,020
So, you've been recording this since at least the 90s.

155
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:56,160
I called it, I called it species two at, I didn't give it the same number of Bucoletrics at Cold Canyon as I did at, this is Cold Canyon, as I did here.

156
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,720
So, Bucoletrics Albertiola is a Bucoletrics species.

157
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,140
It's a different species?

158
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:08,600
Yeah.

159
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,480
It's like a similar species?

160
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,020
I think this one is Cianothiela, but I'm not sure.

161
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,220
And you have it here, a species.

162
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,080
Oh, so these should be binned?

163
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:31,240
Yeah, and this is maybe Albertiola, because Bucoletrics species one at Cold Canyon is not the same as, you know, that was something I told you I would resolve, and I haven't done that yet.

164
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,000
But I started on, and I get so far, and I thought, well, this is going to be quick, but it isn't.

165
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,640
It's a lot of work.

166
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:37,880
Yeah.

167
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,800
So, that needs to be resolved.

168
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,320
So, Bucoletrics is kind of a mess.

169
00:14:48,320 --> 00:15:01,020
But I'll tell you, I'll be able to tell you which is which, but for now, we'll assume that the names I'm using at Davis are correct.

170
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,380
And there's only two, Albertiola and Cianothiela, but I don't think you have enough records to include it here.

171
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:29,000
Cianothiela is another pantry moth, and I think in the early years, I probably failed to differentiate it from the Festiotes gilvacentella.

172
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,560
So, it's probably underrepresented in the early years.

173
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:47,620
It's a confoundingly variable species, and in the middle of the year, it's fairly uniform in phenotype.

174
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,540
But late in the year, it's all over the place, different colors, different banding patterns, and everything else.

175
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,480
I've set aside a bunch of them to dissect this year, and I'm hoping to get things straightened out.

176
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,080
Well, we'll dump that one, too, because it's not an outdoor dwelling.

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,760
And I'll keep sending you corrections and additions, which I hope will clarify things a bit.

178
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:21,400
But I would say with, there's a very high probability that many of them were recorded as gilvacentella during the earliest years.

179
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,180
And how many of the earliest years, I can't tell you.

180
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,240
Gotcha.

181
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,060
I think that's called a raisin moth or something like that.

182
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,180
I need to...

183
00:16:32,180 --> 00:17:02,160
Thank you.
