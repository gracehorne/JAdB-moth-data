0	11160	Annapena Triangulana, the only known host record was feeding on leaf litter underneath willow tree.
12320	17300	And I had a willow in my yard that I had to have removed because it was damaging my roof.
18700	21820	Ah, so that might be why it looks like it's declining.
21820	29860	And I think I only got one or two this year, but the numbers, there was a brief period where it was pretty big numbers.
30000	37240	And Art brought in some that he found, he said, swarming around ivy, which makes no sense.
37400	43560	But unless they feed on leaf litter, because I don't think they're feeding on the live plants.
43660	47060	But if they're feeding on litter, there's a lot of leaf litter under ivy.
48060	53000	So do you know what year you had your willow tree removed? Do you remember?
53420	58060	What year they had the big numbers? You could look in the...
58060	60560	Well, what, when you had your willow tree removed?
62160	62520	Uh...
62520	66520	I don't remember, but it was...
66520	73520	I could look it up. I could tell you that because I had the roof...
73520	76240	Because I'm wondering if that's what happened here.
76740	77220	Could be.
77220	93960	Anstanoptelia marmorodacta is a terrafora that feeds on mints, various mints.
93960	110580	So it has remained kind of consistently present in my yard, but the numbers may vary according to how many herbs are growing in the yard.
110580	112580	In recent years, I grow...
112580	121140	I have some rosemary that's permanent, but I grow basil every year, and that's about the only one.
122080	124880	And whether the moth's feeding on it or not, I can't say.
124980	127120	And what the neighbors are growing, I can't tell you.
127500	128420	Did this...
128420	132760	Do you think that this is real, that you didn't see it in the first, like, five years or so?
132760	136460	I think it's probably real.
136960	141440	Terraforas are not strongly attracted to light in general.
143800	151760	At least that's kind of the anecdotal information I have on the...
152680	155560	Aproima, this black one.
156040	161860	Powell told me that this was another form of the one that I put a name on.
162760	166660	The name of which...
166660	169100	It's the name I'm using for the Cold Canyon one.
169960	172620	But I think it's a different species.
178320	180920	This is anapronina.
180920	182280	A-P-R-O-A-E.
186360	188120	So you think that...
188120	190960	So this is anapronina nigrella nigrella?
190960	191580	Yeah, yeah.
191580	195400	Yeah, Jerry suggested that this is another form of nigrella.
195660	204020	But there's one that looks like it, like this one, that goes under a different name on the Moth Photographers Group worksite.
204360	208780	And it could be that they're both feed on the same food plant.
208920	213040	And that he reared both from larvae collected on the same food plant.
213040	220260	The food plant is what used to be called Lotus scoperia, but the name is not the same anymore.
220440	226060	It's no longer in lotus and may not be scoperia anymore either, but, you know.
226160	228460	So do you think that these are distinct species still?
228460	236440	I don't think they're the same species anymore, because I only get the one farm in Davis, and I rarely get the black ones at Cold Canyon.
236640	237220	Right, okay.
238420	246540	I mean, it could be just a different genetics, but, you know, I don't know.
246740	251860	It looks like they're declining here, and those species are declining in Cold Canyon, so...
251860	257880	Well, at Cold Canyon, because it's lotus, and because that's one that probably burned up in the fire.
258640	260480	That's some stuff we need to know.
260880	261020	Yeah.
261020	264020	I think fire is...
264020	271020	Fire and weediness at Cold Canyon, although lotus scoperia is a weedy plant, so...
271020	284220	Arkeps Argarapha is the fruit tree leaf roller, and it may be increasing because I replaced an exotic ash tree with a pluot tree.
284740	285280	Hmm.
286040	288380	But my neighbor always had a plum tree.
289020	293540	Another neighbor had an apricot, which he removed, so...
293540	295860	So, stones root's been around.
296120	296260	It's always around.
296260	300420	But Arkeps Argarapha, it's always associated with oaks.
300740	305800	You find it in the wild near oaks, and it feeds on oak as well.
305800	315000	So, it's polyphagous, but because it feeds on fruit trees, it's got its common name associated with fruit trees.
315640	318660	But that could be why it's increased in my yard.
318660	328000	And it tends to come to light a little bit later than, say, Klepsis and some of the other torcheses.
328000	334680	So, I would think that if it were...
334680	343000	I don't stay up as late as I did when I was younger, so I would think that if it was declining...
343000	345320	That would be because of that?
345320	350060	You know, we would attribute it to turning in earlier, but it's doing just the opposite.
350240	352360	I've been getting more and more in recent years.
352800	353900	So, I think this is real.
354200	354520	Okay.
354760	359620	But I don't have oaks in my yard, so it's kind of odd that I have it.
359900	361060	Maybe they travel further.
361340	369660	But it doesn't feed on low-growing plants as much as some of the other torcheses.
369660	379600	So, Aristotelia fungiferella, I assume, feeds on some kind of fungus, but I don't know that for certain.
380360	382400	I don't know much about this life history.
382660	387720	I had this one called an Aristotelia species one, I think, for a while.
387720	394120	But it's a dead set match for one on Moth Photographers Group.
394220	397620	So, I think this name is probably correct, but I don't know about it.
398820	401760	Aristotelia species two looks like some of the others.
401900	405200	And I'll tell you which ones I think are all confused with one another.
405500	408380	And I'm certain that this is probably two or more species.
409380	410180	Species two.
410180	417560	And there are quite a few Aristotelia, which I did not record anywhere.
421980	426180	The ones that are distinct have been recorded consistently.
426560	429960	And those are ones that I put a name on, for the most part.
433420	435320	Species three looks like two.
435460	438400	Species four looks a little bit like two.
440180	448120	So, Aspila molesta is the oriental fruit model.
449420	453600	An introduced species, a pest of fruit trees.
453720	460680	It's a tiny tortoise, smaller, much smaller than most of the others.
462040	467680	But it seemed to enjoy some good years and not so much recently.
467680	476040	I think it and Prunivora is another small moth.
476120	477220	This is a native one.
480720	482720	Seem to be in decline.
482860	484200	They've had a few good years.
484200	493440	It's about the same time that the, what was the one we were talking about earlier?
493440	496580	The one in leaf litter.
497220	497540	Oh.
497540	497600	Oh.
505600	506040	Yeah.
508440	510660	I can't remember things for 10 minutes.
510920	511340	Me neither.
512600	513700	Too much in the brain.
513700	524100	I'm wondering, Grace, if you could make a note that maybe we could add a non-linear year predictor
524100	528780	just to capture the species that are having parabolic responses.
530020	536440	Yeah, I think it would be interesting to look at ones which coincidentally show similar patterns.
536440	541140	And boom years and bust years.
541160	542440	Because our model doesn't account for that, right?
543060	543220	Yeah.
543260	556440	Well, there is a possibility because certain parasitoids focus on species that have similar feeding niches.
556440	559060	And they'll be like this.
559260	559620	Yeah.
559980	561120	Oscillate with the parasitoids.
561140	571140	There may be a parasite that feeds on things that make a feeding shelter similar to that of those two species.
571860	576420	I think the leaf litter moth was Annapena triangu.
576420	577360	That's the one, yeah.
577360	587780	Okay, we are at, okay, I talked about these last two at the same time pretty much.
588820	606300	Autographia californica, this is, it's somewhat of a pest species and feeds on an array of plants.
606300	611460	You get a lot of them early and a lot of them late and then sporadically in the middle of the year.
613680	617560	And it seems to have very good years once in a while.
617760	622160	I think the year before, last year was pretty good for it.
622680	623920	Yep, it looks like it was.
625200	627220	Oh, well, we don't have the data from last year, right?
628180	630520	Bactra veritana feeds on sedges.
631240	633480	So that's a weird host plant.
633480	643400	And one year, I guess it was last year or maybe the year before, it really showed extreme numbers.
643580	645300	And then it's down again this year.
645960	651160	But it has shown up somewhat consistently all along.
651160	662560	The gissara buxia seemed to be, my recollection was it was somewhat abundant in the early years
662560	665580	and much less so in recent years.
665840	669440	I haven't been getting it anywhere near the numbers that I used to get it.
669440	674140	Okay, so true decline on that one, probably.
674940	679240	Bedelia somnula telefeeds on plants in the Morning Glory family.
679240	688460	And I've kind of given up trying to keep Morning Glory out of my yard, so that may account for.
689240	694460	But also, it's common in the cold months.
694460	703080	So, because I didn't collect in the cold months as often, partly because I didn't and partly because I couldn't,
703140	709860	because there was more rain in the past, that could explain some of this recent abundance.
709860	724140	Blastobasis glandulella, some of these may have been recorded as blastobasine species unidentified.
725200	731320	These I separated out because they're bigger and considerably bigger than all the other blastobases.
732100	733880	And there seems to be two forms.
733880	743280	So, this could, might be two different species, but the pictures online show two different, the same two different phenotypes.
747860	749180	Borchocenia nephrax.
749220	751600	I only think I have a couple of records for this one.
751660	752920	I'm surprised this is here.
755460	759040	Oh, that's when I get more common earlier in the year, though.
759040	771100	So, that may be why you saw a big spike last year, if that is last year or the year before last.
772240	773760	Yeah, I think it goes up to 2023.
776740	782120	Bucoletrics Albertiola feeds on live oaks, I think.
782200	785260	And it may also feed on other oaks, but certainly live oaks.
785260	804340	Bucoletrics is a tiny moth, and they tend to show up in big numbers during a, when the weather's kind of extreme, either real hot or kind of cold.
806620	812660	It looks like he's been recording this.
812660	814880	You're looking, I think you're looking at the other.
815120	815900	I am, yeah.
816040	821020	So, you've been recording this since at least the 90s.
821640	836160	I called it, I called it species two at, I didn't give it the same number of Bucoletrics at Cold Canyon as I did at, this is Cold Canyon, as I did here.
836160	843720	So, Bucoletrics Albertiola is a Bucoletrics species.
846920	848140	It's a different species?
848500	848600	Yeah.
848600	849480	It's like a similar species?
849520	853020	I think this one is Cianothiela, but I'm not sure.
854600	856220	And you have it here, a species.
857180	859080	Oh, so these should be binned?
859080	871240	Yeah, and this is maybe Albertiola, because Bucoletrics species one at Cold Canyon is not the same as, you know, that was something I told you I would resolve, and I haven't done that yet.
871240	877000	But I started on, and I get so far, and I thought, well, this is going to be quick, but it isn't.
877080	877640	It's a lot of work.
877740	877880	Yeah.
880940	882800	So, that needs to be resolved.
883080	888320	So, Bucoletrics is kind of a mess.
888320	901020	But I'll tell you, I'll be able to tell you which is which, but for now, we'll assume that the names I'm using at Davis are correct.
902380	909380	And there's only two, Albertiola and Cianothiela, but I don't think you have enough records to include it here.
909380	929000	Cianothiela is another pantry moth, and I think in the early years, I probably failed to differentiate it from the Festiotes gilvacentella.
929640	934560	So, it's probably underrepresented in the early years.
934560	947620	It's a confoundingly variable species, and in the middle of the year, it's fairly uniform in phenotype.
948040	954540	But late in the year, it's all over the place, different colors, different banding patterns, and everything else.
954800	960480	I've set aside a bunch of them to dissect this year, and I'm hoping to get things straightened out.
960480	963080	Well, we'll dump that one, too, because it's not an outdoor dwelling.
963080	969760	And I'll keep sending you corrections and additions, which I hope will clarify things a bit.
970080	981400	But I would say with, there's a very high probability that many of them were recorded as gilvacentella during the earliest years.
981600	984180	And how many of the earliest years, I can't tell you.
984900	985240	Gotcha.
986840	990060	I think that's called a raisin moth or something like that.
990700	992180	I need to...
992180	1022160	Thank you.
