0	3240	Especially now when people are changing their landscaping and
3240	10480	they're developing the lots near me and Davis Pond now goes dry when it used to have water in it
10480	17380	the situation is changing considerably you know and I think it changes in different ways than
17380	28320	the natural environment. So onward and upward. Oh we're out of time. Anna Vitranil I talked about.
28320	37740	Anna Vitranil I talked about at Davis and at Davis I didn't get it for a lot of
37740	46500	years and then it showed up and now it's shows up fairly commonly. I previously got it at
46500	57840	the A is missing so or the generic name is missing here. It would be A-N-A if it were showing there.
58320	68340	And you can see it. So this is a real trend. Yeah so this is this is real it didn't show up for a
68340	76360	while but I caught it before that at Cold Canyon and the same thing happens it's been more common
76360	81840	in recent years. I don't know why that is. I don't know enough about the host plants and
81840	91860	they're two species which are similar and in Jerry the book the western moth books
91860	97200	Oppler wrote if you can't tell them apart you need to dissect them. Well I can dissect them
97200	102920	but I don't know which. I don't have illustrations so I don't. Do you know if one or both of these is
102920	108900	native or non-native or you don't know? I don't know but they're probably native. Okay probably native
108900	115840	but you don't know. And you know the other distinction I want to make and I'll say so at the
115840	124620	time is there's non-native but there's also invasive non-native and invasive is somewhat
124620	130860	important too. Well it's a it's a government classification so yeah. I mean this year one of
130860	139340	the pantry moths exploded in my yard. I had no more than five prior to this year and I started getting
139340	151180	them in 2020 and this year I got 43 of them minimum. So that's often the pattern with invasive species
151180	161740	they show up. Ancelus columbia and another species it's not not out. This feeds on Ceanothus it's native
162700	171020	and there's another species which is very similar. This has kind of falcate wing tips and the other one
171020	177820	has more rounded but there's some that's kind of intermediate and I believe the genitalia are so
177820	187740	similar that nobody's quite sure whether these are good species or not but it could be that this is
187740	195420	one of those situations you know like encetina and newts or salamanders and some other things where
195420	200700	they act like good species and part of their range but not in others so I don't know but
200700	208700	Ancelus is a very distinct looking moth. They're all recorded as columbiana but they might be the
208700	216220	other species the name of which doesn't pop into my head right now but I'll probably make that wake up
216220	225340	in the middle of the night and yell it out. Anancia
229100	239340	Anancia are small gray moths and Cosmopterygidae and they look very much like blastobases like the
239340	246460	common blastobases and if you don't look carefully you're going to confuse them with one another.
249900	260540	I believe all are native. Many of them feed on mints. I don't know what fasciata feeds on but this one
260540	270540	is somewhat common. Orites I've reared from mints so I know that one and I think there may be one
270540	278380	or two other species which show up less commonly but because they resemble blastobases if I didn't
278380	286940	look carefully at the specimens I may have erroneously recorded them as that wastebasket category for
286940	295100	blastobases. This year I got one that I've yet to dissect in my yard that may be an Anancia so
295820	300140	that would be interesting because this could be another mint association.
300700	306060	So their host plants are mint so I want to make sure we write down oh well you're getting the um
308060	314700	you're getting the AI version too right okay um I want to make sure that we record host plant and
314700	322540	native versus non-native. Do you think um fasciata also? I believe all Anancia are native. There's no
322540	329260	reason to believe there's not but okay and you think this one feeds on mint even though I don't know the
329260	338300	food plant of fasciata but there is a fascicle on Cosmopteridges and Hodges who wrote it probably
338300	346460	if he had a food plant association he would have written it. The problem with Hodges is
348460	356220	often on material from Berkeley Powell would record if he swept it off a plant he would record that
356220	362460	the adult was on a certain plant but if the adult was there it's not necessarily the
362460	370220	Harville food plant but Hodges uh interpreted that as meaning this is the food plant when
370220	375740	sometimes it wasn't. Okay. But you know the literature is full of errors like that.
379420	387500	Antep, Anteperoe semiotrata is a widespread moth probably it's a geometric
387500	394780	widespread widespread probably native um I think I got it once in my yard but it's
394780	404780	fairly common at Cold Canyon and reasonably easy to identify but some forms of some other geometries are
404780	405260	similar.
405260	417260	apanthesis ornata is a tiger moth uh so tiger moths used to be in their separate family now they're
417260	421260	considered a sub-family of uh
422860	429020	Aribidae, the one that split off from Noctuus on the basis
429020	438780	of wing venation but you know Wagner who rears larvae thinks that a lot of these decisions
439580	445420	if you look at the larvae are supported by larval morphology so tiger moths you know are the woolly
445420	452780	bears and things like that so lots of secondary seeding. Generalists, tiger moths
452780	461660	um many tiger moths seem to fly late at night so if I'm not staying up late at night I may miss them
462940	470940	and um when I was at Briggs Hall you know sometimes in the morning the stairwells there act like a big
470940	478220	flight trap and often you'd see salt marsh caterpillar or another tiger moth in big numbers
478220	486620	um in the stairwell in the morning when you go to work but um you know I I seldom get them in my yard
486620	499660	um tiger moths are subject to heavy parasitization my eye drops make my nose run and uh as well as the cold and
499660	509660	you often see collapses in population so I think Rick Carman one time collected
510300	515900	this big tiger moth that's out at Point Reyes and Bodega Marine Lab brought him back to the
515900	522140	lab to rear and almost all of them were parasitized and I think I did the same thing when I was a kid
522140	536140	uh from ones I got at Point Reyes Apro, Rima, Nigrella and Species One Jerry in the past told me that these were
538220	544220	forms of the same species but I think that's erroneous because I only get the black ones in Davis
544220	555980	Nigrella has black with two one or two bands across the forewing or stripes I should say they're narrow stripes
557580	567020	and they're white or cream colored feeds on um what used to be lotus scoperius but it's been moved out of
567020	579740	lotus I think you know which is the bushy lotus or what used to be lotus deer weed aporama nigrella
581900	583420	and possibly the other one
583420	597420	all right good no um I need water I'll be right back
604620	611420	they're coming
613420	627740	I can't find your hospital is a davis moth as well
628860	638460	fruit tree leaf roller I believe and as I mentioned likely native um almost certainly native I would
638460	639900	even though it's a pest species
642860	646860	and it seems to be most common where there are so what's interesting at
649420	658940	cold canyon is that immediately after fire you don't see it as commonly as
661820	666540	normal years and that could be this depression here on your chart
669260	672860	and another torturous which feeds on low-growing plants
673420	679580	goes from being uncommon to being very common and then they gradually shift in
680540	683420	so I'll talk about that when we get but I talked about our
683420	688220	Kipsaga ross flow before and even though it's somewhat polyphagous
688220	693660	it is most abundant in the vicinity of oaks
697740	707340	Aristotelia argantiferous feeds on coyote bush and specific to it easy to identify unlike most of the
707340	714220	Aristotelia so these are good records and coyote bush gets increasingly
714940	718620	abundant you know it's not an early successor to fire but it
718620	723820	seems to succeed fire much earlier than a lot of other plants do
723820	734540	and all these Aristotelia two for two is probably at least two species the Aristotelian numbers at
736700	739180	Cold Canyon are the same numbers I use for
739820	744860	Davis so two and Davis is the same as two in cold canyon and so forth
746460	748460	two is almost certainly two species
751260	755020	the rest of them not so sure and as I mentioned one of them
755980	760140	is probably not an Aristotelia and that was one of the ones at Davis
760140	765260	when you can take a break so that we can start a new recording so the file doesn't get too big
765260	767900	I'm okay
