{"text": " Especially now when people are changing their landscaping and they're developing the lots near me and Davis Pond now goes dry when it used to have water in it the situation is changing considerably you know and I think it changes in different ways than the natural environment. So onward and upward. Oh we're out of time. Anna Vitranil I talked about. Anna Vitranil I talked about at Davis and at Davis I didn't get it for a lot of years and then it showed up and now it's shows up fairly commonly. I previously got it at the A is missing so or the generic name is missing here. It would be A-N-A if it were showing there. And you can see it. So this is a real trend. Yeah so this is this is real it didn't show up for a while but I caught it before that at Cold Canyon and the same thing happens it's been more common in recent years. I don't know why that is. I don't know enough about the host plants and they're two species which are similar and in Jerry the book the western moth books Oppler wrote if you can't tell them apart you need to dissect them. Well I can dissect them but I don't know which. I don't have illustrations so I don't. Do you know if one or both of these is native or non-native or you don't know? I don't know but they're probably native. Okay probably native but you don't know. And you know the other distinction I want to make and I'll say so at the time is there's non-native but there's also invasive non-native and invasive is somewhat important too. Well it's a it's a government classification so yeah. I mean this year one of the pantry moths exploded in my yard. I had no more than five prior to this year and I started getting them in 2020 and this year I got 43 of them minimum. So that's often the pattern with invasive species they show up. Ancelus columbia and another species it's not not out. This feeds on Ceanothus it's native and there's another species which is very similar. This has kind of falcate wing tips and the other one has more rounded but there's some that's kind of intermediate and I believe the genitalia are so similar that nobody's quite sure whether these are good species or not but it could be that this is one of those situations you know like encetina and newts or salamanders and some other things where they act like good species and part of their range but not in others so I don't know but Ancelus is a very distinct looking moth. They're all recorded as columbiana but they might be the other species the name of which doesn't pop into my head right now but I'll probably make that wake up in the middle of the night and yell it out. Anancia Anancia are small gray moths and Cosmopterygidae and they look very much like blastobases like the common blastobases and if you don't look carefully you're going to confuse them with one another. I believe all are native. Many of them feed on mints. I don't know what fasciata feeds on but this one is somewhat common. Orites I've reared from mints so I know that one and I think there may be one or two other species which show up less commonly but because they resemble blastobases if I didn't look carefully at the specimens I may have erroneously recorded them as that wastebasket category for blastobases. This year I got one that I've yet to dissect in my yard that may be an Anancia so that would be interesting because this could be another mint association. So their host plants are mint so I want to make sure we write down oh well you're getting the um you're getting the AI version too right okay um I want to make sure that we record host plant and native versus non-native. Do you think um fasciata also? I believe all Anancia are native. There's no reason to believe there's not but okay and you think this one feeds on mint even though I don't know the food plant of fasciata but there is a fascicle on Cosmopteridges and Hodges who wrote it probably if he had a food plant association he would have written it. The problem with Hodges is often on material from Berkeley Powell would record if he swept it off a plant he would record that the adult was on a certain plant but if the adult was there it's not necessarily the Harville food plant but Hodges uh interpreted that as meaning this is the food plant when sometimes it wasn't. Okay. But you know the literature is full of errors like that. Antep, Anteperoe semiotrata is a widespread moth probably it's a geometric widespread widespread probably native um I think I got it once in my yard but it's fairly common at Cold Canyon and reasonably easy to identify but some forms of some other geometries are similar. apanthesis ornata is a tiger moth uh so tiger moths used to be in their separate family now they're considered a sub-family of uh Aribidae, the one that split off from Noctuus on the basis of wing venation but you know Wagner who rears larvae thinks that a lot of these decisions if you look at the larvae are supported by larval morphology so tiger moths you know are the woolly bears and things like that so lots of secondary seeding. Generalists, tiger moths um many tiger moths seem to fly late at night so if I'm not staying up late at night I may miss them and um when I was at Briggs Hall you know sometimes in the morning the stairwells there act like a big flight trap and often you'd see salt marsh caterpillar or another tiger moth in big numbers um in the stairwell in the morning when you go to work but um you know I I seldom get them in my yard um tiger moths are subject to heavy parasitization my eye drops make my nose run and uh as well as the cold and you often see collapses in population so I think Rick Carman one time collected this big tiger moth that's out at Point Reyes and Bodega Marine Lab brought him back to the lab to rear and almost all of them were parasitized and I think I did the same thing when I was a kid uh from ones I got at Point Reyes Apro, Rima, Nigrella and Species One Jerry in the past told me that these were forms of the same species but I think that's erroneous because I only get the black ones in Davis Nigrella has black with two one or two bands across the forewing or stripes I should say they're narrow stripes and they're white or cream colored feeds on um what used to be lotus scoperius but it's been moved out of lotus I think you know which is the bushy lotus or what used to be lotus deer weed aporama nigrella and possibly the other one all right good no um I need water I'll be right back they're coming I can't find your hospital is a davis moth as well fruit tree leaf roller I believe and as I mentioned likely native um almost certainly native I would even though it's a pest species and it seems to be most common where there are so what's interesting at cold canyon is that immediately after fire you don't see it as commonly as normal years and that could be this depression here on your chart and another torturous which feeds on low-growing plants goes from being uncommon to being very common and then they gradually shift in so I'll talk about that when we get but I talked about our Kipsaga ross flow before and even though it's somewhat polyphagous it is most abundant in the vicinity of oaks Aristotelia argantiferous feeds on coyote bush and specific to it easy to identify unlike most of the Aristotelia so these are good records and coyote bush gets increasingly abundant you know it's not an early successor to fire but it seems to succeed fire much earlier than a lot of other plants do and all these Aristotelia two for two is probably at least two species the Aristotelian numbers at Cold Canyon are the same numbers I use for Davis so two and Davis is the same as two in cold canyon and so forth two is almost certainly two species the rest of them not so sure and as I mentioned one of them is probably not an Aristotelia and that was one of the ones at Davis when you can take a break so that we can start a new recording so the file doesn't get too big I'm okay", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.24, "text": " Especially now when people are changing their landscaping and", "tokens": [50365, 8545, 586, 562, 561, 366, 4473, 641, 23865, 3381, 293, 50527], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2302529898034521, "compression_ratio": 1.5530973451327434, "no_speech_prob": 1.958452063716143e-12}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 3.24, "end": 10.48, "text": " they're developing the lots near me and Davis Pond now goes dry when it used to have water in it", "tokens": [50527, 436, 434, 6416, 264, 3195, 2651, 385, 293, 15658, 430, 684, 586, 1709, 4016, 562, 309, 1143, 281, 362, 1281, 294, 309, 50889], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2302529898034521, "compression_ratio": 1.5530973451327434, "no_speech_prob": 1.958452063716143e-12}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 10.48, "end": 17.38, "text": " the situation is changing considerably you know and I think it changes in different ways than", "tokens": [50889, 264, 2590, 307, 4473, 31308, 291, 458, 293, 286, 519, 309, 2962, 294, 819, 2098, 813, 51234], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2302529898034521, "compression_ratio": 1.5530973451327434, "no_speech_prob": 1.958452063716143e-12}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 17.38, "end": 28.32, "text": " the natural environment.
