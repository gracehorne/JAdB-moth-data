1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Especially now when people are changing their landscaping and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,480
they're developing the lots near me and Davis Pond now goes dry when it used to have water in it

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,380
the situation is changing considerably you know and I think it changes in different ways than

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:28,320
the natural environment. So onward and upward. Oh we're out of time. Anna Vitranil I talked about.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,740
Anna Vitranil I talked about at Davis and at Davis I didn't get it for a lot of

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:46,500
years and then it showed up and now it's shows up fairly commonly. I previously got it at

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:57,840
the A is missing so or the generic name is missing here. It would be A-N-A if it were showing there.

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:08,340
And you can see it. So this is a real trend. Yeah so this is this is real it didn't show up for a

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:16,360
while but I caught it before that at Cold Canyon and the same thing happens it's been more common

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,840
in recent years. I don't know why that is. I don't know enough about the host plants and

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:31,860
they're two species which are similar and in Jerry the book the western moth books

12
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,200
Oppler wrote if you can't tell them apart you need to dissect them. Well I can dissect them

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,920
but I don't know which. I don't have illustrations so I don't. Do you know if one or both of these is

14
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,900
native or non-native or you don't know? I don't know but they're probably native. Okay probably native

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,840
but you don't know. And you know the other distinction I want to make and I'll say so at the

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:04,620
time is there's non-native but there's also invasive non-native and invasive is somewhat

17
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,860
important too. Well it's a it's a government classification so yeah. I mean this year one of

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:19,340
the pantry moths exploded in my yard. I had no more than five prior to this year and I started getting

19
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:31,180
them in 2020 and this year I got 43 of them minimum. So that's often the pattern with invasive species

20
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:41,740
they show up. Ancelus columbia and another species it's not not out. This feeds on Ceanothus it's native

21
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:51,020
and there's another species which is very similar. This has kind of falcate wing tips and the other one

22
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,820
has more rounded but there's some that's kind of intermediate and I believe the genitalia are so

23
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:07,740
similar that nobody's quite sure whether these are good species or not but it could be that this is

24
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:15,420
one of those situations you know like encetina and newts or salamanders and some other things where

25
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,700
they act like good species and part of their range but not in others so I don't know but

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Ancelus is a very distinct looking moth. They're all recorded as columbiana but they might be the

27
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:36,220
other species the name of which doesn't pop into my head right now but I'll probably make that wake up

28
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:45,340
in the middle of the night and yell it out. Anancia

29
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:59,340
Anancia are small gray moths and Cosmopterygidae and they look very much like blastobases like the

30
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,460
common blastobases and if you don't look carefully you're going to confuse them with one another.

31
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:20,540
I believe all are native. Many of them feed on mints. I don't know what fasciata feeds on but this one

32
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:30,540
is somewhat common. Orites I've reared from mints so I know that one and I think there may be one

33
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,380
or two other species which show up less commonly but because they resemble blastobases if I didn't

34
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:46,940
look carefully at the specimens I may have erroneously recorded them as that wastebasket category for

35
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:55,100
blastobases. This year I got one that I've yet to dissect in my yard that may be an Anancia so

36
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,140
that would be interesting because this could be another mint association.

37
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,060
So their host plants are mint so I want to make sure we write down oh well you're getting the um

38
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,700
you're getting the AI version too right okay um I want to make sure that we record host plant and

39
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,540
native versus non-native. Do you think um fasciata also? I believe all Anancia are native. There's no

40
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,260
reason to believe there's not but okay and you think this one feeds on mint even though I don't know the

41
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:38,300
food plant of fasciata but there is a fascicle on Cosmopteridges and Hodges who wrote it probably

42
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:46,460
if he had a food plant association he would have written it. The problem with Hodges is

43
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,220
often on material from Berkeley Powell would record if he swept it off a plant he would record that

44
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,460
the adult was on a certain plant but if the adult was there it's not necessarily the

45
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:10,220
Harville food plant but Hodges uh interpreted that as meaning this is the food plant when

46
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,740
sometimes it wasn't. Okay. But you know the literature is full of errors like that.

47
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,500
Antep, Anteperoe semiotrata is a widespread moth probably it's a geometric

48
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,780
widespread widespread probably native um I think I got it once in my yard but it's

49
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:44,780
fairly common at Cold Canyon and reasonably easy to identify but some forms of some other geometries are

50
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,260
similar.

51
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:57,260
apanthesis ornata is a tiger moth uh so tiger moths used to be in their separate family now they're

52
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,260
considered a sub-family of uh

53
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,020
Aribidae, the one that split off from Noctuus on the basis

54
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:18,780
of wing venation but you know Wagner who rears larvae thinks that a lot of these decisions

55
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,420
if you look at the larvae are supported by larval morphology so tiger moths you know are the woolly

56
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:32,780
bears and things like that so lots of secondary seeding. Generalists, tiger moths

57
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:41,660
um many tiger moths seem to fly late at night so if I'm not staying up late at night I may miss them

58
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:50,940
and um when I was at Briggs Hall you know sometimes in the morning the stairwells there act like a big

59
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:58,220
flight trap and often you'd see salt marsh caterpillar or another tiger moth in big numbers

60
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:06,620
um in the stairwell in the morning when you go to work but um you know I I seldom get them in my yard

61
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:19,660
um tiger moths are subject to heavy parasitization my eye drops make my nose run and uh as well as the cold and

62
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:29,660
you often see collapses in population so I think Rick Carman one time collected

63
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,900
this big tiger moth that's out at Point Reyes and Bodega Marine Lab brought him back to the

64
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,140
lab to rear and almost all of them were parasitized and I think I did the same thing when I was a kid

65
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:56,140
uh from ones I got at Point Reyes Apro, Rima, Nigrella and Species One Jerry in the past told me that these were

66
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,220
forms of the same species but I think that's erroneous because I only get the black ones in Davis

67
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:15,980
Nigrella has black with two one or two bands across the forewing or stripes I should say they're narrow stripes

68
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:27,020
and they're white or cream colored feeds on um what used to be lotus scoperius but it's been moved out of

69
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:39,740
lotus I think you know which is the bushy lotus or what used to be lotus deer weed aporama nigrella

70
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,420
and possibly the other one

71
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:57,420
all right good no um I need water I'll be right back

72
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,420
they're coming

73
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:27,740
I can't find your hospital is a davis moth as well

74
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:38,460
fruit tree leaf roller I believe and as I mentioned likely native um almost certainly native I would

75
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,900
even though it's a pest species

76
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,860
and it seems to be most common where there are so what's interesting at

77
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:58,940
cold canyon is that immediately after fire you don't see it as commonly as

78
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,540
normal years and that could be this depression here on your chart

79
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,860
and another torturous which feeds on low-growing plants

80
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,580
goes from being uncommon to being very common and then they gradually shift in

81
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,420
so I'll talk about that when we get but I talked about our

82
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,220
Kipsaga ross flow before and even though it's somewhat polyphagous

83
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,660
it is most abundant in the vicinity of oaks

84
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,340
Aristotelia argantiferous feeds on coyote bush and specific to it easy to identify unlike most of the

85
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,220
Aristotelia so these are good records and coyote bush gets increasingly

86
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,620
abundant you know it's not an early successor to fire but it

87
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,820
seems to succeed fire much earlier than a lot of other plants do

88
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:14,540
and all these Aristotelia two for two is probably at least two species the Aristotelian numbers at

89
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,180
Cold Canyon are the same numbers I use for

90
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,860
Davis so two and Davis is the same as two in cold canyon and so forth

91
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
two is almost certainly two species

92
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,020
the rest of them not so sure and as I mentioned one of them

93
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,140
is probably not an Aristotelia and that was one of the ones at Davis

94
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,260
when you can take a break so that we can start a new recording so the file doesn't get too big

95
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,900
I'm okay
