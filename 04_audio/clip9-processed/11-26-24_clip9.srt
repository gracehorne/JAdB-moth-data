1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,600
Okay. Peripediasia. Peripediasia tetarellus is the common long moth.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:19,080
Consequently, we don't see it at Cold Canyon. Or if we have, it's only been an

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:29,000
odd specimen here and there. It replaced the native long moth. And this year it

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,200
seemed to be down in numbers a little bit. But in general, it's fairly common.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,720
And maybe this trend that you're seeing of it disappearing is because people are

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
taking their lines up.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,920
That's interesting.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:59,600
Peripediasia. Some forms of feltia subterranea look very similar to

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,920
Peripediasia. But the hind wing is kind of a giveaway for this one. And I rely pretty heavily

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:17,200
on hind wing. The hind wing of this one is kind of a bluish pearl essence. So it's kind

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:28,800
of like a blue oil slip or something. Big moth throughout the year. I think it has a common

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,360
name. And I think it's a generalist. And it's a, I think it's a cutworm. So the larva is in the soil.

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,480
Would you consider it a pest?

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,720
Occasional pest.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,000
I mean, anything's a pest if it eats something you want.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,960
Yeah. Cutworms, you know, are sometimes pests of cut flowers because they cut the flower before

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,760
you do. You know, they're cutworms because they cut things off at the stem.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,920
Periploca ceanothiella and Periploca juniperi

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,680
are very difficult to tell from one another just based on appearance.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,560
Ceanothiella is, the name suggests fees on ceanothus. It's larger and flies earlier in the year.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Chiniperi is smaller and flies later in the year. They're both black, shiny, shiny black species. And

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,440
the person who did the monograph on the family Cosmopterigina suggested that the sheen has a

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:55,680
different appearance to it. But they don't all shine. So there's some that I continue to

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,320
record as either or. And the reason for that is they're in, they're kind of,

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,920
not that hard. Neither real small nor less small. Even, these are not big. They're all small moths.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,640
So there aren't reliable characteristics? Genitalia. Oh, okay. And I have dissected a number of both.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,080
And I have, you know, even though they're small moths, I've been fortunate to have not

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,520
mess them up while I dissected them. And they're clearly we have juniperi. And clearly we have

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,920
Ceanothiella. But whether we have any of the other paripoca species, that's a possibility.

30
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,960
There was one from Cold Canyon that I dissected that I couldn't identify. It didn't match up

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,480
well with any of the illustrations of the monograph. Juniperi, you know, we discussed this

32
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,320
before. There's no native conifers in the valley. It's described from Sacramento. So it was probably

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:11,840
introduced on ornamental junipers. And ornamental junipers are kind of a good child tolerant plant.

34
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,600
So you can tell, like, the entire ecological history of this region through the lens of the moths.

35
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
That's right. I didn't hear you. You could tell the entire ecological

36
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:32,320
history of this region through the lens of moths. Well, you can find reasons to explain things.

37
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,640
Right. Well, that's what stories are. It's just so cool how they do different things.

38
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay. So I still record some as either or. Okay. So that would mean that not every specimen

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,880
has been recorded. And before I realized that we had juniperi, I might have recorded some as Ceanothiella.

40
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,760
Okay. So it's probably best. Only after I got these really. Lump them? Lump them? Yeah.

41
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,760
It would be nice if we had the collection in front of us so you could see what they look like.

42
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, my God. I forgot to say. That's something. It's always a possibility.

43
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,400
Pyromyzen. There was a guy at the Smithsonian who did a monograph on the genus. This is the geometry.

44
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:33,920
It's a big geometry. And the species are all kind of similar to one another.

45
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:48,720
And as it turned out, he recognized a large number of Western species as well as a large number of

46
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:58,560
ones outside of the West. And it turned out that many of these Western species

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
had similar, if not identical, genitalia.

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:15,120
Well, recently Wagner has done some DNA analysis. And it turns out that most of these Western species

49
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,240
that could not be differentiated on the basis of genitalia have the same DNA fingerprints.

50
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So I think this may be

51
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,880
synonymized with another species.

52
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,080
But for the longest time, because the late flying ones look different than the early flying ones,

53
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,360
I thought we might have two species here. You know, so I got the monograph and I looked and I was

54
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,440
disappointed to see that the genitalia wouldn't work. So there could be regional variation, but also

55
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,040
temporal variation. That explains the difference.

56
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
It looks like it's increasing in both Davis and Cold Canyon.

57
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,320
It could be.

58
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,080
Wagner said something about its abundance. And no, it wasn't this. There's a noctua that looks similar.

59
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
Do you think it's native?

60
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,320
I do. Yeah. It's everywhere. And it's out in the Channel Islands.

61
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:23,520
It's everywhere. Especially now that it's several species are probably one.

62
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
I mean, it's a big genus.

63
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,600
There's a lot of species and many in the East.

64
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,840
And also the things that run into each other, but like...

65
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,680
Yeah, I actually recognize the genus.

66
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah.

67
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,320
Yeah.

68
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,880
Petrophila confusalis.

69
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
I didn't know how to tell them apart for a long time.

70
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
But it turned out that the genitalia...

71
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,120
Harry Lang, who used to be on the faculty here,

72
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,840
he worked on aquatic moths and these have aquatic larvae.

73
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:14,160
So, Grace, in Cold Canyon, sorry.

74
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,320
It's, you see, Jalicollis or Confuselius, and then you have Jalicollis separate.

75
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Yeah, actually, same thing here. So, I think they should all be bent.

76
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
Yeah, they need to be bent.

77
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,920
So, this like Euquomius, I couldn't differentiate from one another.

78
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,720
And then after I learned how to tell them apart,

79
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,600
and this was, I was able to confirm it once I found illustrations of the genitalia,

80
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
one of which was in Harry Lang's book.

81
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,120
Harry Lang wrote this section on

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,520
aquatic moths and aquatic insects of California.

83
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
And that's where, oh, you know, there it is.

84
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,840
Then when I dissected them, the differences are subtle, but now I can tell them on external appearance.

85
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,240
So, the fact that either or is declining is because there's fewer or none that I now

86
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,880
describe to that. So, this is probably one that should be reconsidered, just like Euquomius,

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,520
either or.

88
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,400
Yes, fire up. Nobody's going over it. Nobody cares.

89
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:35,840
So, this funeral, I didn't get, and then it's become increasingly common in recent years.

90
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
And it doesn't, it's not an early or late flying one. It's right there.

91
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Yeah. So, that one's a genuine increase.

92
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,920
Yeah, so, but, you know, before I collected it in Davis, the person who wrote the monograph

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,480
that includes this genus had records of this species from Davis. So, it's not a recent arrival

94
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,280
in Davis. It's been around, but it took a while to get to my neighborhood, I guess.

95
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes. And I'm not sure what it feeds like, but it might be in the monograph.

96
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,680
You know, I think all the records in the monographs are on that

97
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,960
database that's online that you can check. But if not, you can check the monograph.

98
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,480
Yeah. Yeah, I did look up one of them they talked about last time.

99
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,200
Um, Eudonia Spenceri. I said I didn't know what the host plant was. And so, I looked it up,

100
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,120
and they didn't, they didn't know at the time that the monograph was written either. So,

101
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, okay. So, no one knows.

102
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
So, no one knows.

103
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,280
Physiotodes musadella.

104
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,480
Physiotodes musadella and Physiotodes alatella

105
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,560
were kind of combined. And Physiotodes is now three species recognized in the US.

106
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,800
And I've been calling all the Western ones musadella. But whether they all are or not,

107
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,400
I don't know. I don't know what was used to differentiate musadella from alatella.

108
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
But alatella was considered to be a European species, I think. But it's

109
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,200
they're calling the Eastern component of what we used to call alatella or alatella,

110
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,000
subspecies of musadella. They're calling them alatella. So, I'm not quite certain whether

111
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,520
it's a native species or not. And I don't know how to tell it. But what I've called musadella,

112
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,240
I probably all correct, except at Cold Canyon, where I may not have

113
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:05,040
correctly differentiated it from baphyla aramiata. And I have one specimen of baphyla aramiata from

114
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:15,520
my backyard confirmed by dissection. And baphyla aramiata feeds on scale insects. That's a larva.

115
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,000
Whoa. What's the name of this thing?

116
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:31,680
What's the name of this thing? Baphyla, B-A-P-H-A-L-A. Species E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A.

117
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Baphyla, B-A-L-A-A. And it's similar then to Faisatodes.

118
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,320
Yeah. It looks like you have it declining in Davis and in Cold Canyon.

119
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:56,240
It could be. I think Musadella has a wide range of known viral hosts, but I can't.

120
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:05,280
This is speculation on my part. Faisatodes in general are difficult to identify.

121
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:17,040
One of the new species this year is identical, almost identical to a species that I never collected,

122
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,720
but Bill Patterson reported at Quail Ridge. And when I dissected it, it was clearly

123
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,200
not the species that Bill Patterson reported. And, you know, I told Bill, you know,

124
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,880
these might be misidentified. I said, you know, he donated his, so I'll look at them when I have

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,160
a chance and let you know what they are. And he says, well, they look both the same to me.

126
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Bill is really good at telling things, just that external of those. But externally,

127
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,360
the palpia are a bit longer, and there may be a size different, but when you look at picture

128
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,360
photographs, you know, the photographs don't tell you how large they are or what the size range is.

129
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
Do you think this is a native species?

130
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,200
Hard to know. A lot of these, you know, these pantry moths and Faisatines in general,

131
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:24,320
a lot of them are generalists. And so there's the potential that they could have been in any number of

132
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,840
accidentally imported. Can you, I think we're going to have to go through and label these as

133
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,560
native, non-native, or we don't know, just really quickly. So if you could tell me whether you think

134
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
they're native or non-native as we go through. I could tell you what I think, but it might be that

135
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,280
it's online whether they're native or not. Oh, okay. We can double check. But I care what you think, too.

136
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,720
Because I think Wikipedia, you know, Wikipedia sometimes says. But with these micro moths,

137
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,600
it's pretty much your opinion. Yeah. Like, that's what we got.

138
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,520
Well, I'll tell you when I have some knowledge of it. You know, like that Inafila beef lab,

139
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,840
a jury wrote a paper on it, you know. Even when you have a speculation, tell us. Yeah. Okay.

140
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, I can tell you if I think there's a high probability, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We won't

141
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,120
misrepresent or say you said it was native when you don't know. Pigretti and Mert Valdella

142
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,560
disappeared completely for a while. Is that the next one? Um, my phone is about to die. Oh, I got it.
