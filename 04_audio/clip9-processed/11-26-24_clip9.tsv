40	10600	Okay. Peripediasia. Peripediasia tetarellus is the common long moth.
10600	19080	Consequently, we don't see it at Cold Canyon. Or if we have, it's only been an
19080	29000	odd specimen here and there. It replaced the native long moth. And this year it
29000	36200	seemed to be down in numbers a little bit. But in general, it's fairly common.
36200	41720	And maybe this trend that you're seeing of it disappearing is because people are
41720	44720	taking their lines up.
44720	49920	That's interesting.
49920	59600	Peripediasia. Some forms of feltia subterranea look very similar to
59600	67920	Peripediasia. But the hind wing is kind of a giveaway for this one. And I rely pretty heavily
67920	77200	on hind wing. The hind wing of this one is kind of a bluish pearl essence. So it's kind
77200	88800	of like a blue oil slip or something. Big moth throughout the year. I think it has a common
88800	95360	name. And I think it's a generalist. And it's a, I think it's a cutworm. So the larva is in the soil.
95360	100480	Would you consider it a pest?
100480	102720	Occasional pest.
105120	108000	I mean, anything's a pest if it eats something you want.
108000	116960	Yeah. Cutworms, you know, are sometimes pests of cut flowers because they cut the flower before
116960	121760	you do. You know, they're cutworms because they cut things off at the stem.
123760	127920	Periploca ceanothiella and Periploca juniperi
127920	135680	are very difficult to tell from one another just based on appearance.
138480	146560	Ceanothiella is, the name suggests fees on ceanothus. It's larger and flies earlier in the year.
147680	156560	Chiniperi is smaller and flies later in the year. They're both black, shiny, shiny black species. And
158480	165440	the person who did the monograph on the family Cosmopterigina suggested that the sheen has a
165440	175680	different appearance to it. But they don't all shine. So there's some that I continue to
177280	184320	record as either or. And the reason for that is they're in, they're kind of,
184320	191920	not that hard. Neither real small nor less small. Even, these are not big. They're all small moths.
191920	198640	So there aren't reliable characteristics? Genitalia. Oh, okay. And I have dissected a number of both.
199200	204080	And I have, you know, even though they're small moths, I've been fortunate to have not
204080	211520	mess them up while I dissected them. And they're clearly we have juniperi. And clearly we have
211520	217920	Ceanothiella. But whether we have any of the other paripoca species, that's a possibility.
217920	224960	There was one from Cold Canyon that I dissected that I couldn't identify. It didn't match up
224960	230480	well with any of the illustrations of the monograph. Juniperi, you know, we discussed this
230480	238320	before. There's no native conifers in the valley. It's described from Sacramento. So it was probably
239680	251840	introduced on ornamental junipers. And ornamental junipers are kind of a good child tolerant plant.
251840	259600	So you can tell, like, the entire ecological history of this region through the lens of the moths.
259600	263040	That's right. I didn't hear you. You could tell the entire ecological
263040	272320	history of this region through the lens of moths. Well, you can find reasons to explain things.
272320	278640	Right. Well, that's what stories are. It's just so cool how they do different things.
278640	288800	Okay. So I still record some as either or. Okay. So that would mean that not every specimen
288800	296880	has been recorded. And before I realized that we had juniperi, I might have recorded some as Ceanothiella.
296880	301760	Okay. So it's probably best. Only after I got these really. Lump them? Lump them? Yeah.
303280	307760	It would be nice if we had the collection in front of us so you could see what they look like.
307760	312000	Oh, my God. I forgot to say. That's something. It's always a possibility.
317440	324400	Pyromyzen. There was a guy at the Smithsonian who did a monograph on the genus. This is the geometry.
324400	333920	It's a big geometry. And the species are all kind of similar to one another.
336160	348720	And as it turned out, he recognized a large number of Western species as well as a large number of
348720	358560	ones outside of the West. And it turned out that many of these Western species
360160	364240	had similar, if not identical, genitalia.
366720	375120	Well, recently Wagner has done some DNA analysis. And it turns out that most of these Western species
375120	382240	that could not be differentiated on the basis of genitalia have the same DNA fingerprints.
383200	385200	So I think this may be
388480	390880	synonymized with another species.
390880	396080	But for the longest time, because the late flying ones look different than the early flying ones,
396080	401360	I thought we might have two species here. You know, so I got the monograph and I looked and I was
401360	407440	disappointed to see that the genitalia wouldn't work. So there could be regional variation, but also
407440	411040	temporal variation. That explains the difference.
413200	417200	It looks like it's increasing in both Davis and Cold Canyon.
417200	418320	It could be.
421280	428080	Wagner said something about its abundance. And no, it wasn't this. There's a noctua that looks similar.
428800	429680	Do you think it's native?
430880	434320	I do. Yeah. It's everywhere. And it's out in the Channel Islands.
434320	443520	It's everywhere. Especially now that it's several species are probably one.
447040	448240	I mean, it's a big genus.
451040	453600	There's a lot of species and many in the East.
453600	455840	And also the things that run into each other, but like...
455840	457680	Yeah, I actually recognize the genus.
457680	458240	Yeah.
458240	458320	Yeah.
458320	462880	Petrophila confusalis.
466800	469600	I didn't know how to tell them apart for a long time.
470400	472560	But it turned out that the genitalia...
474480	477120	Harry Lang, who used to be on the faculty here,
478400	481840	he worked on aquatic moths and these have aquatic larvae.
481840	494160	So, Grace, in Cold Canyon, sorry.
495520	502320	It's, you see, Jalicollis or Confuselius, and then you have Jalicollis separate.
502320	505040	Yeah, actually, same thing here. So, I think they should all be bent.
505040	506640	Yeah, they need to be bent.
506640	509920	So, this like Euquomius, I couldn't differentiate from one another.
510480	512720	And then after I learned how to tell them apart,
513360	519600	and this was, I was able to confirm it once I found illustrations of the genitalia,
519600	521440	one of which was in Harry Lang's book.
522400	525120	Harry Lang wrote this section on
527280	531520	aquatic moths and aquatic insects of California.
531520	534880	And that's where, oh, you know, there it is.
536880	543840	Then when I dissected them, the differences are subtle, but now I can tell them on external appearance.
546480	554240	So, the fact that either or is declining is because there's fewer or none that I now
555360	560880	describe to that. So, this is probably one that should be reconsidered, just like Euquomius,
560880	561520	either or.
561520	566400	Yes, fire up. Nobody's going over it. Nobody cares.
566400	575840	So, this funeral, I didn't get, and then it's become increasingly common in recent years.
577200	580800	And it doesn't, it's not an early or late flying one. It's right there.
580800	583760	Yeah. So, that one's a genuine increase.
583760	589920	Yeah, so, but, you know, before I collected it in Davis, the person who wrote the monograph
589920	598480	that includes this genus had records of this species from Davis. So, it's not a recent arrival
598480	603280	in Davis. It's been around, but it took a while to get to my neighborhood, I guess.
603280	608000	Yes. And I'm not sure what it feeds like, but it might be in the monograph.
610400	613680	You know, I think all the records in the monographs are on that
615040	620960	database that's online that you can check. But if not, you can check the monograph.
620960	626480	Yeah. Yeah, I did look up one of them they talked about last time.
626480	633200	Um, Eudonia Spenceri. I said I didn't know what the host plant was. And so, I looked it up,
633200	637120	and they didn't, they didn't know at the time that the monograph was written either. So,
637120	639040	Oh, okay. So, no one knows.
639040	641040	So, no one knows.
641760	643280	Physiotodes musadella.
649760	654480	Physiotodes musadella and Physiotodes alatella
654480	662560	were kind of combined. And Physiotodes is now three species recognized in the US.
663360	668800	And I've been calling all the Western ones musadella. But whether they all are or not,
668800	676400	I don't know. I don't know what was used to differentiate musadella from alatella.
677440	683600	But alatella was considered to be a European species, I think. But it's
684960	691200	they're calling the Eastern component of what we used to call alatella or alatella,
691200	698000	subspecies of musadella. They're calling them alatella. So, I'm not quite certain whether
699680	705520	it's a native species or not. And I don't know how to tell it. But what I've called musadella,
705520	712240	I probably all correct, except at Cold Canyon, where I may not have
712240	725040	correctly differentiated it from baphyla aramiata. And I have one specimen of baphyla aramiata from
725040	735520	my backyard confirmed by dissection. And baphyla aramiata feeds on scale insects. That's a larva.
735520	738000	Whoa. What's the name of this thing?
738000	751680	What's the name of this thing? Baphyla, B-A-P-H-A-L-A. Species E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A.
751680	757360	Baphyla, B-A-L-A-A. And it's similar then to Faisatodes.
758160	764320	Yeah. It looks like you have it declining in Davis and in Cold Canyon.
764320	776240	It could be. I think Musadella has a wide range of known viral hosts, but I can't.
776800	785280	This is speculation on my part. Faisatodes in general are difficult to identify.
785280	797040	One of the new species this year is identical, almost identical to a species that I never collected,
797040	806720	but Bill Patterson reported at Quail Ridge. And when I dissected it, it was clearly
807520	813200	not the species that Bill Patterson reported. And, you know, I told Bill, you know,
813200	818880	these might be misidentified. I said, you know, he donated his, so I'll look at them when I have
818880	824160	a chance and let you know what they are. And he says, well, they look both the same to me.
824880	830880	Bill is really good at telling things, just that external of those. But externally,
830880	835360	the palpia are a bit longer, and there may be a size different, but when you look at picture
835360	841360	photographs, you know, the photographs don't tell you how large they are or what the size range is.
841360	843040	Do you think this is a native species?
846640	853200	Hard to know. A lot of these, you know, these pantry moths and Faisatines in general,
853200	864320	a lot of them are generalists. And so there's the potential that they could have been in any number of
864320	871840	accidentally imported. Can you, I think we're going to have to go through and label these as
871840	878560	native, non-native, or we don't know, just really quickly. So if you could tell me whether you think
878560	882000	they're native or non-native as we go through. I could tell you what I think, but it might be that
882000	887280	it's online whether they're native or not. Oh, okay. We can double check. But I care what you think, too.
887280	892720	Because I think Wikipedia, you know, Wikipedia sometimes says. But with these micro moths,
893440	895600	it's pretty much your opinion. Yeah. Like, that's what we got.
896480	901520	Well, I'll tell you when I have some knowledge of it. You know, like that Inafila beef lab,
901520	907840	a jury wrote a paper on it, you know. Even when you have a speculation, tell us. Yeah. Okay.
909360	914000	Well, I can tell you if I think there's a high probability, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We won't
914000	919120	misrepresent or say you said it was native when you don't know. Pigretti and Mert Valdella
919120	926560	disappeared completely for a while. Is that the next one? Um, my phone is about to die. Oh, I got it.
