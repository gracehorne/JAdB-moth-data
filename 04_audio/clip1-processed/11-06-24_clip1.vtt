WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.980
so if it's a matter of purging okay so this is john talking about the moths and the data that

00:09.980 --> 00:17.720
grace has on them on the x-axis is year and on the y-axis is day positives which

00:17.720 --> 00:26.820
is simply the number of times that john saw the moth and we have not adjusted on the y-axis for

00:26.820 --> 00:32.540
the number of times john went out per year so he's going to talk about each moth and what we need

00:32.540 --> 00:40.400
to know about the trends that we're seeing do you want to start with davis yes okay acaira rantalis

00:40.400 --> 00:43.080
and acaira

00:43.080 --> 00:52.020
occidentalis which you don't have here are two very similar species

00:52.020 --> 00:58.460
and rantalis tends to be smaller and

00:58.460 --> 01:07.360
has a more blurred pattern whereas occidentalis is larger you didn't plot occidentalis i see

01:07.360 --> 01:15.340
occidentalis should it be here and we're missing it well we we do have it at davis i do have records

01:15.340 --> 01:21.120
for it at davis but only one or two okay yeah i see so it may not be frequent

01:21.120 --> 01:28.280
the genitalia are different and you can positively identify it by genitalia so i did a number of

01:28.280 --> 01:36.480
um dissections and then since then i've been sorting them out primarily based on size and color but

01:36.480 --> 01:44.180
there's a lot of them that still remain equivocal and those i continue to record as either or

01:44.180 --> 01:48.160
so as a kyra species one of the two above

01:48.160 --> 01:55.300
so early rec early ones if i didn't retain the specimen

01:55.300 --> 02:07.840
may not have been recorded i may not have made an effort to identify it so i always recorded it as

02:07.840 --> 02:14.580
uh one of the two above so maybe we should uh change this to a kyra spa

02:14.580 --> 02:18.660
and well you could lump them all together for all three

02:18.660 --> 02:22.300
bins so the rentalis occidentalis

02:22.300 --> 02:28.600
i think a kyra occidentalis is one of them is known as the garden

02:28.600 --> 02:33.980
something or other so it's a widespread moth the other one is strictly

02:33.980 --> 02:40.920
western and i think that's occidentalis and rantalis is known to be

02:40.920 --> 02:50.080
on alfalfa so i think the years that they grew alfalfa in the fields to the north of where i live

02:50.080 --> 02:56.840
it probably was more common so in general the

02:56.840 --> 03:03.860
number and frequency of them is probably correlated with whether they're

03:03.860 --> 03:10.800
growing alfalfa or not and the small ones which is rantalis seem

03:10.800 --> 03:15.540
to be far more common than the larger ones

03:15.540 --> 03:19.420
and at cold canyon i think mostly i got larger ones

03:19.420 --> 03:25.800
because they don't grow any alfalfa in there but it probably feeds on other things because

03:25.800 --> 03:35.740
um they're somewhat of a generalist okay

03:35.740 --> 03:38.340
should we check the recording and make sure it's working is that what you're thinking

03:38.340 --> 03:42.600
yeah is it still recording do we know are you okay yeah it's still working
