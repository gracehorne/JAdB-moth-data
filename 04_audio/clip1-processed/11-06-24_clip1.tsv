0	9980	so if it's a matter of purging okay so this is john talking about the moths and the data that
9980	17720	grace has on them on the x-axis is year and on the y-axis is day positives which
17720	26820	is simply the number of times that john saw the moth and we have not adjusted on the y-axis for
26820	32540	the number of times john went out per year so he's going to talk about each moth and what we need
32540	40400	to know about the trends that we're seeing do you want to start with davis yes okay acaira rantalis
40400	43080	and acaira
43080	52020	occidentalis which you don't have here are two very similar species
52020	58460	and rantalis tends to be smaller and
58460	67360	has a more blurred pattern whereas occidentalis is larger you didn't plot occidentalis i see
67360	75340	occidentalis should it be here and we're missing it well we we do have it at davis i do have records
75340	81120	for it at davis but only one or two okay yeah i see so it may not be frequent
81120	88280	the genitalia are different and you can positively identify it by genitalia so i did a number of
88280	96480	um dissections and then since then i've been sorting them out primarily based on size and color but
96480	104180	there's a lot of them that still remain equivocal and those i continue to record as either or
104180	108160	so as a kyra species one of the two above
108160	115300	so early rec early ones if i didn't retain the specimen
115300	127840	may not have been recorded i may not have made an effort to identify it so i always recorded it as
127840	134580	uh one of the two above so maybe we should uh change this to a kyra spa
134580	138660	and well you could lump them all together for all three
138660	142300	bins so the rentalis occidentalis
142300	148600	i think a kyra occidentalis is one of them is known as the garden
148600	153980	something or other so it's a widespread moth the other one is strictly
153980	160920	western and i think that's occidentalis and rantalis is known to be
160920	170080	on alfalfa so i think the years that they grew alfalfa in the fields to the north of where i live
170080	176840	it probably was more common so in general the
176840	183860	number and frequency of them is probably correlated with whether they're
183860	190800	growing alfalfa or not and the small ones which is rantalis seem
190800	195540	to be far more common than the larger ones
195540	199420	and at cold canyon i think mostly i got larger ones
199420	205800	because they don't grow any alfalfa in there but it probably feeds on other things because
205800	215740	um they're somewhat of a generalist okay
215740	218340	should we check the recording and make sure it's working is that what you're thinking
218340	222600	yeah is it still recording do we know are you okay yeah it's still working
