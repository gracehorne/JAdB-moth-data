WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
worried about the recording not working because it's so precious it's not working it is working

00:06.280 --> 00:10.780
yeah yeah we're catching all of it i'm just tell you a species b there's two

00:10.780 --> 00:18.960
named species non-determinata and i can't remember the other one

00:18.960 --> 00:26.040
that wagner gave me the names for and there's one of each one from cold canyon one from my

00:26.040 --> 00:32.180
backyard they both look very similar and they both look like what i'm calling calyptelia species b

00:32.180 --> 00:39.300
so i suggest that you include non-determinata and the one from

00:39.300 --> 00:43.960
let's see i might have that and the one from

00:43.960 --> 00:54.700
and the other one as species b which is probably

00:54.700 --> 00:57.060
two or more species

00:57.060 --> 01:04.000
negundella is the other one

01:04.000 --> 01:12.360
and that's negundella is the one as a record from davis and non-determinata is a record from cold

01:12.360 --> 01:12.800
canyon

01:12.800 --> 01:21.180
and wagner gave me names but he gave me a name in the past that made no sense because it was a

01:21.180 --> 01:23.480
moth from florida or something so

01:23.480 --> 01:30.300
you know he travels all over the place and sometimes forgets where he saw things

01:30.300 --> 01:36.100
it's easy to put a name on things it's hard to put the right name on things

01:36.100 --> 01:44.640
okay cameraria whislosinia there may be earlier specimens of this this feeds on

01:44.640 --> 01:52.040
quercus whislosinia surprise which is valley live oak

01:52.040 --> 01:58.500
and i may not have recorded all the early specimens

01:58.500 --> 02:06.240
and it could be more than one species because

02:06.240 --> 02:12.140
many of the cameraria species are very similar to one another

02:12.140 --> 02:16.040
but the one that looks like at a cold canyon is on

02:16.040 --> 02:24.100
quercus lobata or whatever and that isn't in davis so i think they're probably this is

02:24.100 --> 02:32.200
probably one species and probably whislosinia but i've not dissected it it's tiny moth and

02:32.200 --> 02:44.960
it's a demanding dissection caragina montana i think um there's one species that kind of resembles

02:44.960 --> 02:50.880
it but i think they're all the same and there's two discrete generations per year

02:50.880 --> 02:55.740
so i feel pretty good about that but

02:55.740 --> 03:06.960
um caragina and there's species near it proxenus and spodoptera exigua seem to fluctuate in abundance

03:06.960 --> 03:15.800
considerably from year to year and so the probability of collecting them probably increases when they're

03:15.800 --> 03:23.680
having a big year and that may be real calcela ifitalis

03:23.680 --> 03:26.660
feeds and

03:26.660 --> 03:28.800
mud

03:28.800 --> 03:31.260
wasps nests

03:31.260 --> 03:32.860
oh interesting

03:32.860 --> 03:37.880
and one year i had leaky sprinkler system and had a lot of mud

03:37.880 --> 03:43.820
and that year i got a bunch of bud wasps nests under the ease to my house and i think they

03:43.820 --> 03:47.680
may get in and feed on them after their

03:47.680 --> 03:51.900
i don't know whether they feed on the larvae or feed on the debris that's left behind

03:51.900 --> 04:00.780
but that could account for this abundance of them was the year my sprinkler system was leaking

04:00.780 --> 04:02.300
interesting

04:02.300 --> 04:12.940
kyanoti's okrio strigella feeds on sorrel i think

04:12.940 --> 04:22.860
mm-hmm and uh it just shows up in low numbers and some years i get it some years not

04:22.860 --> 04:31.420
but i do sometimes leave my porch light on and some i think i've seen it on my porch light

04:31.420 --> 04:34.140
more often than i've seen it in my backyard

04:34.140 --> 04:48.220
kyanoti's paloli um fees on oaks and i may have confused it there's one record of restio from early in the year and

04:48.220 --> 04:52.140
males are easy to identify they have

04:52.140 --> 04:54.600
a sex

04:54.600 --> 04:55.480
linked

04:55.480 --> 04:56.540
character

04:56.540 --> 04:59.200
that you can't miss but the females

04:59.200 --> 05:01.060
are hard to differentiate

05:01.060 --> 05:02.560
from another species

05:02.560 --> 05:04.120
and

05:04.120 --> 05:09.280
folker heinrich who collects erin davis

05:09.280 --> 05:10.480
has been calling them

05:10.480 --> 05:12.980
occidentalis but i think his

05:12.980 --> 05:16.360
i think that's erroneous okay

05:16.360 --> 05:20.320
kyanoti's trichostola

05:20.320 --> 05:23.040
um

05:23.040 --> 05:29.400
it seems to overwinter as adults

05:29.400 --> 05:30.380
um

05:30.380 --> 05:31.500
and so you

05:31.500 --> 05:35.940
if i weren't wasn't collecting earlier in the year i may have missed a lot of them

05:35.940 --> 05:38.220
or late in the year

05:38.220 --> 05:38.840
um

05:38.840 --> 05:41.860
but

05:41.860 --> 05:47.940
the fresh specimens seem to come out in the middle of the year so i guess it goes into

05:47.940 --> 05:49.780
reproductive diaposism

05:49.780 --> 05:50.820
and

05:50.820 --> 05:59.680
i think it feeds on oaks but other things again there's a monograph on kyanoti's and the food plants of many of these are known

05:59.680 --> 06:06.780
it looks like it's maybe declining in stubs and increasing in davis which is the first time i've seen that

06:06.780 --> 06:17.960
could be because you know the oaks got hammered by the fires in cold canyon

06:17.960 --> 06:24.880
it's a dark one

06:24.880 --> 06:31.600
once you learn to recognize it it's easy to recognize but

06:31.600 --> 06:35.980
it's hard to learn to recognize it

06:35.980 --> 06:37.900
it doesn't you know it's kind of

06:37.900 --> 06:40.900
nondescript but very consistent

06:40.900 --> 06:41.620
so

06:41.620 --> 06:53.620
copta trichimedia striata don't know much about it um i recorded this as a

06:53.620 --> 06:57.640
buccolatrix

06:57.640 --> 06:59.460
um

06:59.460 --> 07:06.420
at both sites for a while and then realized it wasn't a buccolatrix i was always suspicious of it because

07:06.420 --> 07:09.640
it was lacking one of the characters that buccolatrix has

07:09.640 --> 07:18.200
what are we talking about copta trichimedia striata or similar species

07:18.200 --> 07:22.420
and i'm pretty sure it's all one species but which species i don't know

07:22.420 --> 07:24.200
so you confused it with

07:24.200 --> 07:26.820
i thought it was a buccolatrix species

07:26.820 --> 07:27.380
okay

07:27.380 --> 07:30.660
so do you think in those early years not collecting it is

07:30.660 --> 07:34.020
it would have been recorded as buccolatrix species one or two

07:34.020 --> 07:40.100
i'm not sure which one i think species one at one locality and species two at the other

07:40.100 --> 07:46.180
but i did make an effort to change all the records on all the data

07:46.180 --> 07:49.780
on all of the spreadsheets

07:49.780 --> 07:54.300
custa convexus centra strigaria

07:54.300 --> 07:57.580
wait oh hold on one second so you corrected

07:57.580 --> 08:02.180
you corrected the data these i think are all correct and all entered

08:02.180 --> 08:07.160
so you think you really didn't see it in the very early years or you think that that's

08:07.160 --> 08:08.280
well i may not have seen it

08:08.280 --> 08:12.920
when i turned 65 which would have been 2010

08:12.920 --> 08:18.620
um i was called in for driver's license

08:18.620 --> 08:23.720
so i went to the optometrist and got glasses because i knew

08:23.720 --> 08:25.540
i was going to flunk the

08:25.540 --> 08:32.160
and all of a sudden small moths appeared at my sheet once again

08:32.160 --> 08:36.440
so i don't think that i was as good at collecting small moths

08:36.440 --> 08:40.060
in those few years prior to 2010

08:40.060 --> 08:44.080
okay we'll deal with these grace i think we're just going to have to have like low

08:44.080 --> 08:47.800
confident species models and higher confidence that sort of thing

08:47.800 --> 08:48.720
yeah okay

08:48.720 --> 08:52.680
um sorry i could we just go over these three again

08:52.680 --> 09:03.140
coliophora sacramenta is a white coliophora it's one of the few that's very different from the others

09:03.140 --> 09:05.160
and um

09:05.160 --> 09:14.320
it has a i dissected a lot of the coliophora because i had a collection

09:14.320 --> 09:21.520
of illustrations of the genitalia of almost all of the name species of which there are hundreds

09:21.520 --> 09:30.520
and most of them didn't match anything but this one does seem to be a good match for sacramenta

09:30.520 --> 09:33.260
and it's a white one so it's very distinctive

09:33.260 --> 09:39.860
so every specimen that i collected was of a white coliophora was recorded as sacramenta

09:39.860 --> 09:43.760
and we talked about peritana

09:43.760 --> 09:46.620
so this is you think this is a real pattern where you just haven't seen it

09:46.620 --> 09:48.200
i haven't seen any in recent years

09:48.200 --> 09:52.520
so it could be that whatever it was feeding on

09:52.520 --> 10:00.000
removed or it could be a parasite thing

10:00.000 --> 10:04.660
uh do you so do we go over this essentially

10:04.660 --> 10:06.880
i think we did but not on record so maybe if we can

10:06.880 --> 10:13.380
oh yeah coliophora are external leaf miners if that makes it

10:13.380 --> 10:14.180
uh-huh yeah

10:14.180 --> 10:17.160
they make a um shelter

10:17.160 --> 10:24.420
and there's a feeding tube as a feeding tube you know like if you have closed moths in your house

10:24.420 --> 10:28.100
they make that little feeding shelter that they carry around

10:28.100 --> 10:31.840
well they have a mobile shelter that's made from whatever they're feeding on

10:31.840 --> 10:37.860
and groups of them with similar genitalia have similar feeding shelters

10:37.860 --> 10:39.560
so some are kind of pistol shaped

10:39.560 --> 10:41.440
and some are short tubes

10:41.440 --> 10:42.620
some are long tubes

10:42.620 --> 10:44.000
some are tapering tubes

10:44.000 --> 10:44.680
and so on

10:44.680 --> 10:47.220
and um

10:47.220 --> 10:52.140
most leaf miners crash from time to time due to parasitism

10:52.140 --> 10:57.920
so i don't know whether coleophora also crashes due to parasitism

10:57.920 --> 11:01.140
or not but that might explain why this has disappeared

11:01.140 --> 11:03.860
and then it takes a while to build up again

11:03.860 --> 11:05.680
hey no

11:05.680 --> 11:06.640
i mean

11:06.640 --> 11:10.580
coleophora species b is the most common one around here

11:10.580 --> 11:13.140
and i've been meaning to compare this to

11:13.140 --> 11:17.340
a species that was introduced for control of

11:17.340 --> 11:18.760
russian thistle

11:18.760 --> 11:21.100
tumbleweed

11:21.100 --> 11:24.440
is that what mario started

11:24.440 --> 11:26.380
because that wasn't in the

11:26.380 --> 11:29.440
that wasn't in the book of genitalia

11:29.440 --> 11:29.960
no maybe

11:29.960 --> 11:31.520
i think it's a different thistle

11:31.520 --> 11:32.120
yeah

11:32.120 --> 11:33.100
but this one

11:33.100 --> 11:36.500
was in enormous numbers and seems to be in decline

11:36.500 --> 11:37.120
recently

11:37.120 --> 11:39.700
and if it is the one on tumbleweed

11:39.700 --> 11:42.400
there's not as much tumbleweed around davis anymore

11:42.400 --> 11:49.460
and whether it feeds on other um plants in the same family or not i don't know but

11:49.460 --> 11:57.680
this is probably most coleophora are probably host specific or

11:57.680 --> 12:01.700
narrowly um

12:01.700 --> 12:03.040
what do they call it

12:03.040 --> 12:03.520
oligo

12:03.520 --> 12:05.700
i can't remember the terminology

12:05.700 --> 12:06.360
oligophagus

12:06.360 --> 12:07.100
yeah

12:07.100 --> 12:08.640
i think

12:08.640 --> 12:13.560
oh the technical terms that i don't use anymore

12:13.560 --> 12:15.200
i never know how to say them either because i read them

12:15.200 --> 12:16.020
yeah

12:16.020 --> 12:20.640
not only that they redefine the term all the time and i can't keep up with it

12:20.640 --> 12:24.820
costa convexo sensus sagaria getting back to that

12:24.820 --> 12:30.720
i probably confused it with ortho nema obstepata in the early years

12:30.720 --> 12:34.920
and they're somewhat difficult to tell apart

12:34.920 --> 12:35.860
um

12:35.860 --> 12:43.540
there are many that are clearly one or clearly the others but others are kind of difficult to tell apart

12:43.540 --> 12:47.640
but it looks like in these early years you found them really rarely

12:47.640 --> 12:49.620
you think that's real

12:49.620 --> 12:54.700
but again this is one that a lot of records are early and late too so

12:54.700 --> 12:55.600
mm-hmm

13:04.600 --> 13:09.560
john would you just would you mind um going over the clepsis peritona again just for the recording

13:09.560 --> 13:10.520
clepsis peritona again

13:10.520 --> 13:11.400
just for the recording

13:11.400 --> 13:11.860
okay

13:11.860 --> 13:13.840
clepsis peritona is

13:13.840 --> 13:15.100
polyphagus

13:15.100 --> 13:18.380
feeds on low growing plants

13:18.380 --> 13:27.440
and in the back corner i took out the lawn in a section of my backyard

13:27.440 --> 13:31.160
and for a while i was

13:31.160 --> 13:35.740
growing tomatoes which never bore fruit

13:35.740 --> 13:41.780
and a number of garlic which never divided into cloves and a number of other things

13:41.780 --> 13:45.680
so i kind of abandoned urban farmer

13:45.680 --> 13:51.680
and it's gotten weedy and it's gotten overrun by this thimbleberry

13:51.680 --> 13:56.580
and so i think that's what it's feeding on my yard and maybe that's why it's become common

13:56.580 --> 13:59.580
but also there's a lot of late records for it

13:59.580 --> 14:09.580
like it's the most common species in my yard in late October and early November

14:09.580 --> 14:17.080
i mean i've been getting them the last few nights and sometimes multiples

14:17.080 --> 14:19.480
where everything else is

14:19.480 --> 14:22.480
very occasionally and

14:22.480 --> 14:24.480
just one or two

14:24.480 --> 14:28.180
got it

14:28.180 --> 14:28.580
yeah

14:28.580 --> 14:29.480
thank you

14:29.480 --> 14:37.480
um maybe if we get through all of the seas we could take a break because we are all the time

14:37.480 --> 14:42.380
i'm willing to stay as long as you would like if you're okay staying but it's

14:42.380 --> 14:44.380
i have to go do you have to go

14:44.380 --> 14:46.380
um

14:46.380 --> 14:50.380
we have writing group but i can skip some of it probably

14:50.380 --> 14:52.380
and you can keep recording

14:52.380 --> 14:54.380
after your break and

14:54.380 --> 15:00.380
maybe you and john can even if it's possible find another time this week to try and keep going

15:00.380 --> 15:04.380
yeah and you can use our phone to call africa if you want

15:04.380 --> 15:08.280
well she's going to use her own phone so

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
um

15:09.280 --> 15:11.280
yeah let's finish out the seas

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
okay i'm at city of latiferiana

15:13.280 --> 15:15.280
that's the filbert moth

15:15.280 --> 15:16.280
and

15:16.280 --> 15:20.280
here it probably feeds mainly in acorns

15:20.280 --> 15:22.280
oh cute

15:22.280 --> 15:23.280
and

15:23.280 --> 15:27.280
i don't seem to get as many as greg does and greg has

15:27.280 --> 15:33.280
oaks in his yard and i don't so that could explain it but it shows up throughout the year

15:33.280 --> 15:35.180
and

15:35.180 --> 15:38.180
i don't know whether it's in decline or not but

15:43.180 --> 15:49.180
all i can say is greg records it much more often in a much bigger numbers than i do so

15:49.180 --> 15:51.180
i think because i don't have oaks around

15:51.180 --> 15:54.080
it's in decline in both habitats

15:54.080 --> 15:56.080
pardon me

15:56.080 --> 16:00.080
it's in decline in uh stebs too probably the fire thing

16:00.080 --> 16:01.080
oh

16:01.080 --> 16:04.080
yeah could be

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
um

16:05.080 --> 16:07.080
i don't know what other

16:07.080 --> 16:16.980
well it's called the filbert moth so obviously it gets in other kind of nuts and kernels and so forth

16:16.980 --> 16:20.980
so i don't know what the full range of its host species is

16:20.980 --> 16:24.880
city of pominella is

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880
the

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
codling moth

16:30.880 --> 16:31.880
and i don't think

16:31.880 --> 16:33.880
you know this is a pest species and

16:33.880 --> 16:35.780
and

16:35.780 --> 16:39.780
the numbers vary from year to year in my yard and i

16:39.780 --> 16:41.780
it's

16:41.780 --> 16:44.780
didn't seem to be very common this year and

16:44.780 --> 16:45.780
uh

16:45.780 --> 16:47.780
this suggests a kind i

16:47.780 --> 16:49.780
i don't think i've ever seen it at

16:49.780 --> 16:50.780
um

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
cold canyon

16:51.780 --> 16:53.480
i don't think i have one record for it

16:53.480 --> 16:53.880
no you don't

16:53.880 --> 16:54.280
so

16:54.280 --> 16:55.480
it's a pest species

16:55.480 --> 16:57.280
it's an introduced pest species

16:57.280 --> 16:58.480
and it seems to be

16:59.480 --> 17:02.080
closely associated with orchard crops

17:07.780 --> 17:12.280
diastictus fracturalis feeds on grasses

17:12.780 --> 17:13.680
presumably

17:14.280 --> 17:14.780
and

17:14.980 --> 17:18.480
so here's a case where there's one that seems to be increasing

17:18.480 --> 17:19.780
in

17:19.780 --> 17:22.080
abundance

17:22.080 --> 17:24.780
whereas those two agriphalus species

17:24.780 --> 17:27.280
which are also sod moths are

17:27.280 --> 17:28.780
in decline so

17:28.780 --> 17:32.280
it could be that one is replacing the other

17:32.280 --> 17:37.280
you know because the introduced lawn moth which we don't see at cold canyon

17:37.280 --> 17:38.380
has

17:38.380 --> 17:40.980
pretty much displaced the native

17:40.980 --> 17:41.380
uh

17:41.380 --> 17:44.880
lawn moth or sod moth

17:44.880 --> 17:47.780
do we want to

17:47.780 --> 17:51.280
finish up with the diagrammas before you guys take a break

17:51.280 --> 17:51.880
diagram

17:51.880 --> 17:54.580
diagramia california area is

17:54.580 --> 17:55.580
uh

17:55.580 --> 17:58.680
feeds on conifer maybe more than one species

17:58.680 --> 18:01.680
this is one even though there was a recent

18:01.680 --> 18:03.480
monograph on

18:03.480 --> 18:04.780
this

18:04.780 --> 18:07.280
group of geometric moths

18:07.280 --> 18:08.380
um

18:08.380 --> 18:10.980
this was one section

18:10.980 --> 18:13.780
that wasn't satisfactorily

18:13.780 --> 18:14.980
resolved

18:14.980 --> 18:16.280
it's somewhat variable

18:16.280 --> 18:17.780
and i've been calling

18:17.780 --> 18:19.980
uh oh

18:19.980 --> 18:20.980
i just

18:20.980 --> 18:22.380
i'm talking about the wrong one

18:22.380 --> 18:24.180
california area i think is

18:24.180 --> 18:24.480
on the

18:24.480 --> 18:25.680
and

18:25.680 --> 18:26.180
um

18:26.180 --> 18:29.680
i'd have to look up what the food plant is

18:29.680 --> 18:31.480
this is not the conifer one that's

18:31.480 --> 18:32.580
multiple species

18:32.580 --> 18:35.380
but it could be that at cold canyon

18:35.380 --> 18:37.480
the small ones have been recorded

18:37.480 --> 18:37.880
as

18:37.880 --> 18:39.180
delictata

18:39.180 --> 18:40.680
is that one in there

18:40.680 --> 18:42.380
okay

18:42.380 --> 18:45.280
i think i started recording it later

18:45.280 --> 18:45.780
um

18:45.780 --> 18:48.080
and

18:48.080 --> 18:49.780
i did some dissections

18:49.780 --> 18:51.980
i did some dissections of these

18:51.980 --> 18:53.580
to determine that we have it

18:53.580 --> 18:54.980
and

18:54.980 --> 18:58.280
i only had a few records of this

18:58.280 --> 18:59.080
and

18:59.080 --> 19:00.780
muscariata

19:00.780 --> 19:02.880
in the early years and both of them

19:02.880 --> 19:03.680
have

19:03.680 --> 19:05.980
increased in numbers

19:05.980 --> 19:08.680
you think that's real

19:08.680 --> 19:09.180
yeah

19:09.180 --> 19:09.680
in the habitat

19:09.680 --> 19:10.080
okay

19:10.080 --> 19:13.680
i mean not only has the occurrences

19:13.680 --> 19:15.880
increased but the numbers have increased

19:15.880 --> 19:17.780
yeah it's interesting like

19:17.780 --> 19:18.780
for

19:18.780 --> 19:19.980
muscataria

19:19.980 --> 19:21.580
muscariata

19:21.580 --> 19:21.880
yeah

19:21.880 --> 19:22.680
yeah muscariata

19:22.680 --> 19:24.880
it looks like it went up a lot

19:24.880 --> 19:25.480
like

19:25.480 --> 19:26.280
maybe

19:26.280 --> 19:27.380
2015

19:27.380 --> 19:28.080
yeah

19:28.080 --> 19:28.580
2016

19:28.580 --> 19:29.080
and then

19:29.080 --> 19:30.980
it's a really nice curve here

19:30.980 --> 19:32.080
one of them

19:32.080 --> 19:33.780
is known to feed on

19:33.780 --> 19:34.580
lotus

19:34.580 --> 19:36.180
and the other one

19:36.180 --> 19:38.880
i can't remember now

19:38.880 --> 19:46.880
i'm surprised that i can remember any of this to tell you the truth

19:46.880 --> 19:47.680
yeah

19:47.680 --> 19:48.180
it's incredible

19:48.180 --> 19:49.880
you have a lot in your brain

19:49.880 --> 19:50.380
yeah

19:50.380 --> 19:55.480
diagramia

19:55.480 --> 19:56.580
aerorata

19:56.580 --> 19:59.580
looks very similar to

19:59.580 --> 20:02.280
diagramia

20:02.280 --> 20:03.780
neptaria

20:03.780 --> 20:05.780
and

20:05.780 --> 20:07.780
i think i

20:07.780 --> 20:09.480
i did some dissections

20:09.480 --> 20:11.360
and i think that i am

20:11.360 --> 20:13.520
correctly identifying them all

20:13.520 --> 20:13.840
but

20:13.840 --> 20:15.920
mistakes could have been made

20:15.920 --> 20:18.080
and neither one of them

20:18.080 --> 20:20.360
aerorata seems to be the

20:20.360 --> 20:22.060
more common one in my yard

20:22.060 --> 20:24.760
and i don't know what the situation is

20:24.760 --> 20:27.260
with neptaria

20:27.260 --> 20:29.460
i'm not sure that they're calling it neptaria

20:29.460 --> 20:30.760
that's still anymore

20:30.760 --> 20:32.020
maybe plamolata

20:32.020 --> 20:38.460
plamolata feeds on willow

20:38.460 --> 20:41.500
so plamolata and

20:41.500 --> 20:44.760
neptaria are both in your data set

20:44.760 --> 20:46.460
do you think that they are distinct

20:46.460 --> 20:47.100
no

20:47.100 --> 20:49.680
plamolata i used to call something else

20:49.680 --> 20:51.080
but i can't remember the name

20:51.080 --> 20:55.680
but we have the other one here

20:55.680 --> 20:55.920
and

20:55.920 --> 20:56.480
what's

20:56.480 --> 20:57.680
what's the other one neptaria

20:57.680 --> 20:59.380
i get neptaria in my yard

20:59.380 --> 21:00.540
but not as often as

21:00.540 --> 21:01.320
aerorata

21:01.320 --> 21:02.780
and it's

21:02.780 --> 21:04.980
i guess it didn't make this

21:04.980 --> 21:09.340
aerorata is in

21:09.340 --> 21:10.080
yeah

21:10.080 --> 21:10.880
it didn't

21:10.880 --> 21:12.180
it didn't make the charts

21:12.180 --> 21:12.480
oh

21:12.480 --> 21:14.520
yeah it didn't make the charts

21:14.520 --> 21:15.320
so i don't have

21:15.320 --> 21:17.000
so do you think that

21:17.000 --> 21:20.600
aerorata and neptaria

21:20.600 --> 21:21.980
and plamolata

21:21.980 --> 21:24.180
do you think that we should lump them

21:24.180 --> 21:26.060
you think they're distinct

21:26.060 --> 21:28.460
plamolata is very distinct from the other two

21:28.460 --> 21:30.340
but aerorata and neptaria

21:30.340 --> 21:31.860
are somewhat similar

21:31.860 --> 21:33.900
and i've been

21:33.900 --> 21:35.900
i did some dissections

21:35.900 --> 21:36.720
and then i

21:36.720 --> 21:38.780
after dissecting a number

21:38.780 --> 21:39.620
where there were

21:39.620 --> 21:41.660
seemed to be differences

21:41.660 --> 21:43.140
which worked

21:43.140 --> 21:44.400
i started

21:44.400 --> 21:45.240
sorting them

21:45.240 --> 21:46.020
on the basis

21:46.020 --> 21:47.120
okay

21:47.120 --> 21:47.900
of similarity

21:47.900 --> 21:49.680
to dissected specimens

21:49.680 --> 21:51.520
but when i look at

21:51.520 --> 21:53.720
illustrations online

21:53.720 --> 21:55.580
um

21:55.580 --> 21:58.080
they don't necessarily agree

21:58.080 --> 21:58.480
with

21:58.480 --> 22:00.340
the way i'm sorting them

22:00.340 --> 22:01.620
but the ones online

22:01.620 --> 22:02.820
haven't been dissected

22:02.820 --> 22:03.100
so

22:03.100 --> 22:04.120
they could be

22:04.120 --> 22:04.920
misidentified

22:04.920 --> 22:05.520
well i'm

22:05.520 --> 22:06.480
i'm trusting you

22:06.480 --> 22:06.780
john

22:06.780 --> 22:08.460
i think we should lump those

22:08.460 --> 22:10.220
there were a lot of errors

22:10.220 --> 22:11.120
uh you know

22:11.120 --> 22:12.100
or in the early days

22:12.100 --> 22:13.540
of moth photographers group

22:13.540 --> 22:14.060
and they've been

22:14.060 --> 22:15.260
getting straightened out

22:15.260 --> 22:16.260
but now we have

22:16.260 --> 22:17.200
i naturalists

22:17.200 --> 22:18.020
with all of these

22:18.020 --> 22:18.600
amateur

22:18.600 --> 22:20.320
lepidopterists

22:20.320 --> 22:21.320
posting pictures

22:21.320 --> 22:21.880
of things

22:21.880 --> 22:22.900
and it's

22:22.900 --> 22:24.220
you know

22:24.220 --> 22:25.640
it's good that we get

22:25.640 --> 22:26.220
the records

22:26.220 --> 22:27.020
but it's bad

22:27.020 --> 22:27.720
that we get

22:27.720 --> 22:29.880
unsubstantiated one

22:29.880 --> 22:31.020
and

22:31.020 --> 22:32.140
you can go in there

22:32.140 --> 22:32.900
and identify them

22:32.900 --> 22:34.080
and make them research grade

22:34.080 --> 22:35.360
do you do that ever

22:35.360 --> 22:36.960
well

22:36.960 --> 22:37.740
um

22:37.740 --> 22:38.720
some people have

22:38.720 --> 22:39.960
but i don't post things

22:39.960 --> 22:40.880
on i naturalist

22:40.880 --> 22:41.400
oh god

22:41.400 --> 22:42.060
that's a shame

22:42.060 --> 22:43.140
grace

22:43.140 --> 22:44.220
before i forget

22:44.220 --> 22:45.100
grace

22:45.100 --> 22:46.140
i do think that

22:46.140 --> 22:46.500
um

22:46.500 --> 22:47.440
we're gonna have to go back

22:47.440 --> 22:48.760
to the original data set

22:48.760 --> 22:49.960
and recapture

22:49.960 --> 22:51.220
um

22:51.220 --> 22:53.920
like for instance

22:53.920 --> 22:55.420
iraida didn't make it

22:55.420 --> 22:56.600
into that data set

22:56.600 --> 22:57.980
but

22:57.980 --> 22:59.500
because it doesn't have

22:59.500 --> 23:00.700
no iraida did

23:00.700 --> 23:02.020
neptaria didn't make it

23:02.020 --> 23:02.600
in davis

23:02.600 --> 23:03.860
oh okay

23:03.860 --> 23:04.100
right

23:04.100 --> 23:04.820
i thought it would have

23:04.820 --> 23:05.620
had enough records

23:05.620 --> 23:07.200
but i guess i didn't

23:07.200 --> 23:08.080
so we'll have to go back

23:08.080 --> 23:08.920
and rescue those

23:08.920 --> 23:09.960
if we're gonna lump them

23:09.960 --> 23:10.880
do you see what i'm saying

23:10.880 --> 23:12.400
okay so we're

23:12.400 --> 23:13.500
we're lumping

23:13.500 --> 23:14.760
iraida and

23:14.760 --> 23:15.560
neptaria

23:15.560 --> 23:16.200
together

23:16.200 --> 23:17.320
i think so

23:17.320 --> 23:17.820
okay

23:17.820 --> 23:19.280
i don't know that it would

23:19.280 --> 23:20.680
change things very much

23:20.680 --> 23:21.000
but

23:21.000 --> 23:22.400
and

23:22.400 --> 23:24.780
it probably won't

23:24.780 --> 23:26.180
do you see what i'm saying

23:26.180 --> 23:27.480
about the original data set

23:27.480 --> 23:28.420
mm-hmm

23:28.420 --> 23:29.020
okay

23:29.020 --> 23:31.020
well we'll decide what to do

23:31.020 --> 23:31.620
with all of these

23:31.620 --> 23:32.300
we'll just like

23:32.300 --> 23:33.100
uh

23:33.100 --> 23:34.020
come up with strategies

23:34.020 --> 23:35.180
and run them by john

23:35.180 --> 23:36.000
um

23:36.000 --> 23:40.640
okay i have to run

23:40.640 --> 23:41.840
this is so
