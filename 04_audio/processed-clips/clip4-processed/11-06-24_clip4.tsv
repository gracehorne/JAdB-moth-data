0	6280	worried about the recording not working because it's so precious it's not working it is working
6280	10780	yeah yeah we're catching all of it i'm just tell you a species b there's two
10780	18960	named species non-determinata and i can't remember the other one
18960	26040	that wagner gave me the names for and there's one of each one from cold canyon one from my
26040	32180	backyard they both look very similar and they both look like what i'm calling calyptelia species b
32180	39300	so i suggest that you include non-determinata and the one from
39300	43960	let's see i might have that and the one from
43960	54700	and the other one as species b which is probably
54700	57060	two or more species
57060	64000	negundella is the other one
64000	72360	and that's negundella is the one as a record from davis and non-determinata is a record from cold
72360	72800	canyon
72800	81180	and wagner gave me names but he gave me a name in the past that made no sense because it was a
81180	83480	moth from florida or something so
83480	90300	you know he travels all over the place and sometimes forgets where he saw things
90300	96100	it's easy to put a name on things it's hard to put the right name on things
96100	104640	okay cameraria whislosinia there may be earlier specimens of this this feeds on
104640	112040	quercus whislosinia surprise which is valley live oak
112040	118500	and i may not have recorded all the early specimens
118500	126240	and it could be more than one species because
126240	132140	many of the cameraria species are very similar to one another
132140	136040	but the one that looks like at a cold canyon is on
136040	144100	quercus lobata or whatever and that isn't in davis so i think they're probably this is
144100	152200	probably one species and probably whislosinia but i've not dissected it it's tiny moth and
152200	164960	it's a demanding dissection caragina montana i think um there's one species that kind of resembles
164960	170880	it but i think they're all the same and there's two discrete generations per year
170880	175740	so i feel pretty good about that but
175740	186960	um caragina and there's species near it proxenus and spodoptera exigua seem to fluctuate in abundance
186960	195800	considerably from year to year and so the probability of collecting them probably increases when they're
195800	203680	having a big year and that may be real calcela ifitalis
203680	206660	feeds and
206660	208800	mud
208800	211260	wasps nests
211260	212860	oh interesting
212860	217880	and one year i had leaky sprinkler system and had a lot of mud
217880	223820	and that year i got a bunch of bud wasps nests under the ease to my house and i think they
223820	227680	may get in and feed on them after their
227680	231900	i don't know whether they feed on the larvae or feed on the debris that's left behind
231900	240780	but that could account for this abundance of them was the year my sprinkler system was leaking
240780	242300	interesting
242300	252940	kyanoti's okrio strigella feeds on sorrel i think
252940	262860	mm-hmm and uh it just shows up in low numbers and some years i get it some years not
262860	271420	but i do sometimes leave my porch light on and some i think i've seen it on my porch light
271420	274140	more often than i've seen it in my backyard
274140	288220	kyanoti's paloli um fees on oaks and i may have confused it there's one record of restio from early in the year and
288220	292140	males are easy to identify they have
292140	294600	a sex
294600	295480	linked
295480	296540	character
296540	299200	that you can't miss but the females
299200	301060	are hard to differentiate
301060	302560	from another species
302560	304120	and
304120	309280	folker heinrich who collects erin davis
309280	310480	has been calling them
310480	312980	occidentalis but i think his
312980	316360	i think that's erroneous okay
316360	320320	kyanoti's trichostola
320320	323040	um
323040	329400	it seems to overwinter as adults
329400	330380	um
330380	331500	and so you
331500	335940	if i weren't wasn't collecting earlier in the year i may have missed a lot of them
335940	338220	or late in the year
338220	338840	um
338840	341860	but
341860	347940	the fresh specimens seem to come out in the middle of the year so i guess it goes into
347940	349780	reproductive diaposism
349780	350820	and
350820	359680	i think it feeds on oaks but other things again there's a monograph on kyanoti's and the food plants of many of these are known
359680	366780	it looks like it's maybe declining in stubs and increasing in davis which is the first time i've seen that
366780	377960	could be because you know the oaks got hammered by the fires in cold canyon
377960	384880	it's a dark one
384880	391600	once you learn to recognize it it's easy to recognize but
391600	395980	it's hard to learn to recognize it
395980	397900	it doesn't you know it's kind of
397900	400900	nondescript but very consistent
400900	401620	so
401620	413620	copta trichimedia striata don't know much about it um i recorded this as a
413620	417640	buccolatrix
417640	419460	um
419460	426420	at both sites for a while and then realized it wasn't a buccolatrix i was always suspicious of it because
426420	429640	it was lacking one of the characters that buccolatrix has
429640	438200	what are we talking about copta trichimedia striata or similar species
438200	442420	and i'm pretty sure it's all one species but which species i don't know
442420	444200	so you confused it with
444200	446820	i thought it was a buccolatrix species
446820	447380	okay
447380	450660	so do you think in those early years not collecting it is
450660	454020	it would have been recorded as buccolatrix species one or two
454020	460100	i'm not sure which one i think species one at one locality and species two at the other
460100	466180	but i did make an effort to change all the records on all the data
466180	469780	on all of the spreadsheets
469780	474300	custa convexus centra strigaria
474300	477580	wait oh hold on one second so you corrected
477580	482180	you corrected the data these i think are all correct and all entered
482180	487160	so you think you really didn't see it in the very early years or you think that that's
487160	488280	well i may not have seen it
488280	492920	when i turned 65 which would have been 2010
492920	498620	um i was called in for driver's license
498620	503720	so i went to the optometrist and got glasses because i knew
503720	505540	i was going to flunk the
505540	512160	and all of a sudden small moths appeared at my sheet once again
512160	516440	so i don't think that i was as good at collecting small moths
516440	520060	in those few years prior to 2010
520060	524080	okay we'll deal with these grace i think we're just going to have to have like low
524080	527800	confident species models and higher confidence that sort of thing
527800	528720	yeah okay
528720	532680	um sorry i could we just go over these three again
532680	543140	coliophora sacramenta is a white coliophora it's one of the few that's very different from the others
543140	545160	and um
545160	554320	it has a i dissected a lot of the coliophora because i had a collection
554320	561520	of illustrations of the genitalia of almost all of the name species of which there are hundreds
561520	570520	and most of them didn't match anything but this one does seem to be a good match for sacramenta
570520	573260	and it's a white one so it's very distinctive
573260	579860	so every specimen that i collected was of a white coliophora was recorded as sacramenta
579860	583760	and we talked about peritana
583760	586620	so this is you think this is a real pattern where you just haven't seen it
586620	588200	i haven't seen any in recent years
588200	592520	so it could be that whatever it was feeding on
592520	600000	removed or it could be a parasite thing
600000	604660	uh do you so do we go over this essentially
604660	606880	i think we did but not on record so maybe if we can
606880	613380	oh yeah coliophora are external leaf miners if that makes it
613380	614180	uh-huh yeah
614180	617160	they make a um shelter
617160	624420	and there's a feeding tube as a feeding tube you know like if you have closed moths in your house
624420	628100	they make that little feeding shelter that they carry around
628100	631840	well they have a mobile shelter that's made from whatever they're feeding on
631840	637860	and groups of them with similar genitalia have similar feeding shelters
637860	639560	so some are kind of pistol shaped
639560	641440	and some are short tubes
641440	642620	some are long tubes
642620	644000	some are tapering tubes
644000	644680	and so on
644680	647220	and um
647220	652140	most leaf miners crash from time to time due to parasitism
652140	657920	so i don't know whether coleophora also crashes due to parasitism
657920	661140	or not but that might explain why this has disappeared
661140	663860	and then it takes a while to build up again
663860	665680	hey no
665680	666640	i mean
666640	670580	coleophora species b is the most common one around here
670580	673140	and i've been meaning to compare this to
673140	677340	a species that was introduced for control of
677340	678760	russian thistle
678760	681100	tumbleweed
681100	684440	is that what mario started
684440	686380	because that wasn't in the
686380	689440	that wasn't in the book of genitalia
689440	689960	no maybe
689960	691520	i think it's a different thistle
691520	692120	yeah
692120	693100	but this one
693100	696500	was in enormous numbers and seems to be in decline
696500	697120	recently
697120	699700	and if it is the one on tumbleweed
699700	702400	there's not as much tumbleweed around davis anymore
702400	709460	and whether it feeds on other um plants in the same family or not i don't know but
709460	717680	this is probably most coleophora are probably host specific or
717680	721700	narrowly um
721700	723040	what do they call it
723040	723520	oligo
723520	725700	i can't remember the terminology
725700	726360	oligophagus
726360	727100	yeah
727100	728640	i think
728640	733560	oh the technical terms that i don't use anymore
733560	735200	i never know how to say them either because i read them
735200	736020	yeah
736020	740640	not only that they redefine the term all the time and i can't keep up with it
740640	744820	costa convexo sensus sagaria getting back to that
744820	750720	i probably confused it with ortho nema obstepata in the early years
750720	754920	and they're somewhat difficult to tell apart
754920	755860	um
755860	763540	there are many that are clearly one or clearly the others but others are kind of difficult to tell apart
763540	767640	but it looks like in these early years you found them really rarely
767640	769620	you think that's real
769620	774700	but again this is one that a lot of records are early and late too so
774700	775600	mm-hmm
784600	789560	john would you just would you mind um going over the clepsis peritona again just for the recording
789560	790520	clepsis peritona again
790520	791400	just for the recording
791400	791860	okay
791860	793840	clepsis peritona is
793840	795100	polyphagus
795100	798380	feeds on low growing plants
798380	807440	and in the back corner i took out the lawn in a section of my backyard
807440	811160	and for a while i was
811160	815740	growing tomatoes which never bore fruit
815740	821780	and a number of garlic which never divided into cloves and a number of other things
821780	825680	so i kind of abandoned urban farmer
825680	831680	and it's gotten weedy and it's gotten overrun by this thimbleberry
831680	836580	and so i think that's what it's feeding on my yard and maybe that's why it's become common
836580	839580	but also there's a lot of late records for it
839580	849580	like it's the most common species in my yard in late October and early November
849580	857080	i mean i've been getting them the last few nights and sometimes multiples
857080	859480	where everything else is
859480	862480	very occasionally and
862480	864480	just one or two
864480	868180	got it
868180	868580	yeah
868580	869480	thank you
869480	877480	um maybe if we get through all of the seas we could take a break because we are all the time
877480	882380	i'm willing to stay as long as you would like if you're okay staying but it's
882380	884380	i have to go do you have to go
884380	886380	um
886380	890380	we have writing group but i can skip some of it probably
890380	892380	and you can keep recording
892380	894380	after your break and
894380	900380	maybe you and john can even if it's possible find another time this week to try and keep going
900380	904380	yeah and you can use our phone to call africa if you want
904380	908280	well she's going to use her own phone so
908280	909280	um
909280	911280	yeah let's finish out the seas
911280	913280	okay i'm at city of latiferiana
913280	915280	that's the filbert moth
915280	916280	and
916280	920280	here it probably feeds mainly in acorns
920280	922280	oh cute
922280	923280	and
923280	927280	i don't seem to get as many as greg does and greg has
927280	933280	oaks in his yard and i don't so that could explain it but it shows up throughout the year
933280	935180	and
935180	938180	i don't know whether it's in decline or not but
943180	949180	all i can say is greg records it much more often in a much bigger numbers than i do so
949180	951180	i think because i don't have oaks around
951180	954080	it's in decline in both habitats
954080	956080	pardon me
956080	960080	it's in decline in uh stebs too probably the fire thing
960080	961080	oh
961080	964080	yeah could be
964080	965080	um
965080	967080	i don't know what other
967080	976980	well it's called the filbert moth so obviously it gets in other kind of nuts and kernels and so forth
976980	980980	so i don't know what the full range of its host species is
980980	984880	city of pominella is
984880	985880	the
988880	989880	codling moth
990880	991880	and i don't think
991880	993880	you know this is a pest species and
993880	995780	and
995780	999780	the numbers vary from year to year in my yard and i
999780	1001780	it's
1001780	1004780	didn't seem to be very common this year and
1004780	1005780	uh
1005780	1007780	this suggests a kind i
1007780	1009780	i don't think i've ever seen it at
1009780	1010780	um
1010780	1011780	cold canyon
1011780	1013480	i don't think i have one record for it
1013480	1013880	no you don't
1013880	1014280	so
1014280	1015480	it's a pest species
1015480	1017280	it's an introduced pest species
1017280	1018480	and it seems to be
1019480	1022080	closely associated with orchard crops
1027780	1032280	diastictus fracturalis feeds on grasses
1032780	1033680	presumably
1034280	1034780	and
1034980	1038480	so here's a case where there's one that seems to be increasing
1038480	1039780	in
1039780	1042080	abundance
1042080	1044780	whereas those two agriphalus species
1044780	1047280	which are also sod moths are
1047280	1048780	in decline so
1048780	1052280	it could be that one is replacing the other
1052280	1057280	you know because the introduced lawn moth which we don't see at cold canyon
1057280	1058380	has
1058380	1060980	pretty much displaced the native
1060980	1061380	uh
1061380	1064880	lawn moth or sod moth
1064880	1067780	do we want to
1067780	1071280	finish up with the diagrammas before you guys take a break
1071280	1071880	diagram
1071880	1074580	diagramia california area is
1074580	1075580	uh
1075580	1078680	feeds on conifer maybe more than one species
1078680	1081680	this is one even though there was a recent
1081680	1083480	monograph on
1083480	1084780	this
1084780	1087280	group of geometric moths
1087280	1088380	um
1088380	1090980	this was one section
1090980	1093780	that wasn't satisfactorily
1093780	1094980	resolved
1094980	1096280	it's somewhat variable
1096280	1097780	and i've been calling
1097780	1099980	uh oh
1099980	1100980	i just
1100980	1102380	i'm talking about the wrong one
1102380	1104180	california area i think is
1104180	1104480	on the
1104480	1105680	and
1105680	1106180	um
1106180	1109680	i'd have to look up what the food plant is
1109680	1111480	this is not the conifer one that's
1111480	1112580	multiple species
1112580	1115380	but it could be that at cold canyon
1115380	1117480	the small ones have been recorded
1117480	1117880	as
1117880	1119180	delictata
1119180	1120680	is that one in there
1120680	1122380	okay
1122380	1125280	i think i started recording it later
1125280	1125780	um
1125780	1128080	and
1128080	1129780	i did some dissections
1129780	1131980	i did some dissections of these
1131980	1133580	to determine that we have it
1133580	1134980	and
1134980	1138280	i only had a few records of this
1138280	1139080	and
1139080	1140780	muscariata
1140780	1142880	in the early years and both of them
1142880	1143680	have
1143680	1145980	increased in numbers
1145980	1148680	you think that's real
1148680	1149180	yeah
1149180	1149680	in the habitat
1149680	1150080	okay
1150080	1153680	i mean not only has the occurrences
1153680	1155880	increased but the numbers have increased
1155880	1157780	yeah it's interesting like
1157780	1158780	for
1158780	1159980	muscataria
1159980	1161580	muscariata
1161580	1161880	yeah
1161880	1162680	yeah muscariata
1162680	1164880	it looks like it went up a lot
1164880	1165480	like
1165480	1166280	maybe
1166280	1167380	2015
1167380	1168080	yeah
1168080	1168580	2016
1168580	1169080	and then
1169080	1170980	it's a really nice curve here
1170980	1172080	one of them
1172080	1173780	is known to feed on
1173780	1174580	lotus
1174580	1176180	and the other one
1176180	1178880	i can't remember now
1178880	1186880	i'm surprised that i can remember any of this to tell you the truth
1186880	1187680	yeah
1187680	1188180	it's incredible
1188180	1189880	you have a lot in your brain
1189880	1190380	yeah
1190380	1195480	diagramia
1195480	1196580	aerorata
1196580	1199580	looks very similar to
1199580	1202280	diagramia
1202280	1203780	neptaria
1203780	1205780	and
1205780	1207780	i think i
1207780	1209480	i did some dissections
1209480	1211360	and i think that i am
1211360	1213520	correctly identifying them all
1213520	1213840	but
1213840	1215920	mistakes could have been made
1215920	1218080	and neither one of them
1218080	1220360	aerorata seems to be the
1220360	1222060	more common one in my yard
1222060	1224760	and i don't know what the situation is
1224760	1227260	with neptaria
1227260	1229460	i'm not sure that they're calling it neptaria
1229460	1230760	that's still anymore
1230760	1232020	maybe plamolata
1232020	1238460	plamolata feeds on willow
1238460	1241500	so plamolata and
1241500	1244760	neptaria are both in your data set
1244760	1246460	do you think that they are distinct
1246460	1247100	no
1247100	1249680	plamolata i used to call something else
1249680	1251080	but i can't remember the name
1251080	1255680	but we have the other one here
1255680	1255920	and
1255920	1256480	what's
1256480	1257680	what's the other one neptaria
1257680	1259380	i get neptaria in my yard
1259380	1260540	but not as often as
1260540	1261320	aerorata
1261320	1262780	and it's
1262780	1264980	i guess it didn't make this
1264980	1269340	aerorata is in
1269340	1270080	yeah
1270080	1270880	it didn't
1270880	1272180	it didn't make the charts
1272180	1272480	oh
1272480	1274520	yeah it didn't make the charts
1274520	1275320	so i don't have
1275320	1277000	so do you think that
1277000	1280600	aerorata and neptaria
1280600	1281980	and plamolata
1281980	1284180	do you think that we should lump them
1284180	1286060	you think they're distinct
1286060	1288460	plamolata is very distinct from the other two
1288460	1290340	but aerorata and neptaria
1290340	1291860	are somewhat similar
1291860	1293900	and i've been
1293900	1295900	i did some dissections
1295900	1296720	and then i
1296720	1298780	after dissecting a number
1298780	1299620	where there were
1299620	1301660	seemed to be differences
1301660	1303140	which worked
1303140	1304400	i started
1304400	1305240	sorting them
1305240	1306020	on the basis
1306020	1307120	okay
1307120	1307900	of similarity
1307900	1309680	to dissected specimens
1309680	1311520	but when i look at
1311520	1313720	illustrations online
1313720	1315580	um
1315580	1318080	they don't necessarily agree
1318080	1318480	with
1318480	1320340	the way i'm sorting them
1320340	1321620	but the ones online
1321620	1322820	haven't been dissected
1322820	1323100	so
1323100	1324120	they could be
1324120	1324920	misidentified
1324920	1325520	well i'm
1325520	1326480	i'm trusting you
1326480	1326780	john
1326780	1328460	i think we should lump those
1328460	1330220	there were a lot of errors
1330220	1331120	uh you know
1331120	1332100	or in the early days
1332100	1333540	of moth photographers group
1333540	1334060	and they've been
1334060	1335260	getting straightened out
1335260	1336260	but now we have
1336260	1337200	i naturalists
1337200	1338020	with all of these
1338020	1338600	amateur
1338600	1340320	lepidopterists
1340320	1341320	posting pictures
1341320	1341880	of things
1341880	1342900	and it's
1342900	1344220	you know
1344220	1345640	it's good that we get
1345640	1346220	the records
1346220	1347020	but it's bad
1347020	1347720	that we get
1347720	1349880	unsubstantiated one
1349880	1351020	and
1351020	1352140	you can go in there
1352140	1352900	and identify them
1352900	1354080	and make them research grade
1354080	1355360	do you do that ever
1355360	1356960	well
1356960	1357740	um
1357740	1358720	some people have
1358720	1359960	but i don't post things
1359960	1360880	on i naturalist
1360880	1361400	oh god
1361400	1362060	that's a shame
1362060	1363140	grace
1363140	1364220	before i forget
1364220	1365100	grace
1365100	1366140	i do think that
1366140	1366500	um
1366500	1367440	we're gonna have to go back
1367440	1368760	to the original data set
1368760	1369960	and recapture
1369960	1371220	um
1371220	1373920	like for instance
1373920	1375420	iraida didn't make it
1375420	1376600	into that data set
1376600	1377980	but
1377980	1379500	because it doesn't have
1379500	1380700	no iraida did
1380700	1382020	neptaria didn't make it
1382020	1382600	in davis
1382600	1383860	oh okay
1383860	1384100	right
1384100	1384820	i thought it would have
1384820	1385620	had enough records
1385620	1387200	but i guess i didn't
1387200	1388080	so we'll have to go back
1388080	1388920	and rescue those
1388920	1389960	if we're gonna lump them
1389960	1390880	do you see what i'm saying
1390880	1392400	okay so we're
1392400	1393500	we're lumping
1393500	1394760	iraida and
1394760	1395560	neptaria
1395560	1396200	together
1396200	1397320	i think so
1397320	1397820	okay
1397820	1399280	i don't know that it would
1399280	1400680	change things very much
1400680	1401000	but
1401000	1402400	and
1402400	1404780	it probably won't
1404780	1406180	do you see what i'm saying
1406180	1407480	about the original data set
1407480	1408420	mm-hmm
1408420	1409020	okay
1409020	1411020	well we'll decide what to do
1411020	1411620	with all of these
1411620	1412300	we'll just like
1412300	1413100	uh
1413100	1414020	come up with strategies
1414020	1415180	and run them by john
1415180	1416000	um
1416000	1420640	okay i have to run
1420640	1421840	this is so
1421840	1422420	well you know
1422420	1423760	one time run through
1423760	1424760	may not be enough
1424760	1426560	the data
