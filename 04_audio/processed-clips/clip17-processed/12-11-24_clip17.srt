1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
All right, we're back.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,340
Do you have anything at 10, Grace?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,880
No.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,560
Me neither.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,260
Something at 11.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,280
Okay, yeah.

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,380
Probably need to wrap up by like 10.15 or 10.30.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,900
Cyanoti sabiniai feeds on Pinus sabiniana.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,700
And it's a small one with narrow black wings.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,280
And I've dissected enough of them to know that at least some of them are the species.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,540
So every Cyanotis with small, black, narrow wings I've called sabiniani.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,040
But every species has a similar looking species.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,120
And many of them have species out here.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Trichostola is one of the more common ones in Davis.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:08,080
And it has dark wings and a characteristic patch at the base of the forewings that you can't see until the wings are extended.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,060
But it's very diagnostic.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,520
And it seems to be fairly common at Davis as well.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,020
But, see, after Herbert disappeared, that may be, you know, fires were very damaging to oaks.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,900
And the last fire seemed to be devastating to oaks.

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,580
So I don't know why there's not so many in that span of years.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,500
But there should have been.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,360
Yeah, because the fire was 2015, right?

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,680
Yeah.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,940
You know, the other thing that happens is often I put things away to dissect.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,140
And if I don't get around to it, they get misplaced.

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,320
And I don't find them again for several years.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:04,900
So these troublesome genera, for which I do have genitalia, may be underrepresented across the board.

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,400
You know, not just this one.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,440
But, you know, once I learned of that character on the wings of Trichostola, I no longer needed to dissect them.

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:27,260
So, that's the problem you face when dealing with work in process, progress.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,640
And it's going to be in progress forever.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:43,640
Caristinera rosaceana is, I think they call it the oblique-banded leaf roller or something like that.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:55,440
And it feeds on a broad number of plants, so it's occasionally a garden pest.

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,260
But I don't know that it's an economic pest.

35
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:07,100
And it's fairly easy to recognize, although there is another Tartricid and another genus, which is somewhat similar.

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,820
But it seems to come and go.

37
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:16,340
So, you know, I got it for a few years in my backyard and then one every now and then.

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,940
It showed up with greater frequency on Cold Canyon.

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:39,500
And it has a sinuous leading edge of the forewing, which makes it somewhat easy to identify, except that it's not the only Tartricid with that.

40
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,660
And many Tartricids have that similar-looking banded butter.

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,320
But I think that all of these are recorded accurately and inclusively.

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:57,600
There's a tour.

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,340
Yeah.

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,200
Kids.

45
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,320
Carista Stigma Elegantalis.

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,320
As well as Carista Zeppirellis.

47
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:21,800
One of them is yellow and red and fairly, you know, pops on the sheet so you don't forget to collect them.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:31,760
Where the other one is more of a nondescript looking and brown.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,820
And it seemed that they were more common in the early days of the survey.

50
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:48,440
They disappeared for a while and then I started getting Zeppirellis again, I think, or Elegantalis.

51
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,420
I can't remember.

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Anyway, the flashy-looking one seems to be less common than it used to be.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,960
And the other one kind of came and went.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,560
These are, I think, Cranbids, but they might be Pirellis.

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm pretty sure they're Cranbids.

56
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,240
Yep, Cranbid.

57
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,500
Celidasis conspecta.

58
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,900
That's a generic change.

59
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,100
Can you call up a picture and then I'll know what it is?

60
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,780
Oh, okay.

61
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah, that's a Nottadonid.

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:43,380
And it was a subspecies of a more widely distributed one until the recent monographs.

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,080
And Wagner thought that Miller, who was the first author of the monographs, was a splitter.

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,560
And he kept asking me to get a female so that he could rear these.

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,820
But, you know, once you start looking for something for Wagner, they seem to disappear.

66
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,100
And so I never got the...

67
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,440
But, you know, I sent him another species that he was interested in.

68
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,920
And he got all the data wrong in the monographs.

69
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,380
So, in a way, I'm glad he didn't get it.

70
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
So, I was able to get an unpublished...

71
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
I was able to get an unpublished...

72
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I was able to get an unpublished...

73
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
I was able to get an unpublished set of...

74
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
I was able to get an unpublished...

75
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,380
I was able to get an unpublished...

76
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,780
A genus that has hundreds and hundreds of species.

77
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,940
And most of the Western species did not seem to be described.

78
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:58,940
So, I was able to get an unpublished set of genital illustrations of all the name species.

79
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,580
And a few of some that had a manuscript name, a name that hadn't been published.

80
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,620
And when I did the dissection, I was only able to match up a couple of them.

81
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,580
Acordella...

82
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,600
I can't remember now.

83
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,300
I've reared this, and it's either on lotus or on willow.

84
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,500
I think it's on lotus.

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,360
And coleophoras are like clothes moths.

86
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
They make a feeding shelter and crawl around with it.

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,520
So, they're like caddisflies in a way, like terrestrial caddisflies.

88
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,520
And then they stick out their head and mine leaves.

89
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,220
And then they attach to the leaf and spin a cocoon.

90
00:07:50,220 --> 00:08:00,220
But what's interesting is they feed from the end attached to the leaves, but they emerge from the other end.

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:10,460
So, at some point, they turn around within that shelter, which is barely bigger than their diameter.

92
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,500
And clothes moths do the same thing.

93
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,900
So, it's kind of interesting that they do that.

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Disco striata feeds on ceanothus.

95
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,380
And this was one I was able to match up.

96
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,320
And not only did I match them up, I went to Berkeley and looked at some identified specimens.

97
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:43,200
And so, both the genitalia and specimens at Berkeley look like this one.

98
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,900
So, these are probably all recorded and all recorded correctly.

99
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,760
Both of these are very similar looking.

100
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,720
But in the preface to that unpublished set of genitalia illustrations,

101
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,920
the authors caution that some species look like other species and you need to dissect them to be sure.

102
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:16,740
But it's hard to get things published that are small moths that most people don't care very much for.

103
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:28,200
Condica MRSA was, when I first started the survey, known as Droughtia.

104
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,520
Droughtia, something or other, completely different species, different genus, different species.

105
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:48,140
I think it may feed on a plant that, I can't think of.

106
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:55,540
So, Wagner was working on these for a while and he had me send him food plant.

107
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,140
I can't remember the name of it, but it's one of the plants that's down in the stream bed.

108
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,360
Rather than up in the chaparral zone or in the woody areas.

109
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,020
Do you know what it looks like?

110
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Pardon me?

111
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,340
The plant?

112
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,760
Oh, Droughtia Lunata was the former name of this one.

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,260
Mm-hmm.

114
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,460
And, uh...

115
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,120
Do you think it's native?

116
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
I think so.

117
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,360
And there is another condica called Al...

118
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Al...

119
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Al...

120
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,860
Al something or other.

121
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,080
This is somewhat similar.

122
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:51,860
And before I realized there were two species, I may have confused some of the less recorded species with, um...

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,880
Droughtia Lunata.

124
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,960
This moth has a long flight period.

125
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:11,420
And that could mean that there's multiple generations or it could mean that it overwinters as an adult or does not lay the eggs till late in the year.

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,020
I don't know.

127
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:25,940
So if any droughtial lunata remain in your database, they should be changed to condica mercy.

128
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh, are these black widows?

129
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh, my God.

130
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,960
Oh, we can move if you want.

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,700
But I think they're coming and going pretty good.

132
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:54,460
Cosmia Kalami is a Noctua. There was a paper on them recently which may have some information

133
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,540
on whether they're native or not. I think they're native but I don't know for sure.

134
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,980
Fairly easy to recognize. It has a band with a

135
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:15,100
little wave in it that's consistent and different than you see in any other banded.

136
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,180
There are other species in the genus but this seems to be the only one around here.

137
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,860
And they range in color from almost white to

138
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:36,300
kind of a soft brown in color. And the band is sometimes contrasting

139
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,820
considerably with the ground the rest of the wing.

140
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,660
Crambus spariolus is a crambus. There are with a white

141
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,300
streak down near the leading edge of the forewing.

142
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:02,540
As are other crambus species. These are sod moths. They feed in the soil

143
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,420
or the root crown of grasses. And

144
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,860
I suspect they do better in good rain years than in poor rain years but I don't know.

145
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,540
In Davis it disappeared in my yard for a long time and then came back.

146
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:30,620
I thought it had completely disappeared and had been replaced by the

147
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,100
introduced non-native

148
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,620
lawn moth. But it came back.

149
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:51,900
Cydia latiferiana is the filbert moth, I think. Am I correct?

150
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,700
I think so. Let's see. Yep. Filbert worm.

151
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,700
Okay. Okay. It's a filbert worm moth is what it is.

152
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:15,260
The specialist who works on this part of tortrices believes that this is a complex of species

153
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:27,180
under one name. There's quite a bit of variability and he thinks that what might be going on is that

154
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:34,940
there's host races that are becoming specialized and by doing so are also

155
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,100
becoming sexually isolated from other host races.

156
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:51,580
So this may be either a case of host race races that are evolving into species

157
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:01,100
species or host races which because of the pests are now alongside one another and

158
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,340
merging to become one species. It's hard to know what the direction is going on. You know,

159
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:13,980
we had the same thing going on with the moss. I studied spruce budworms. They were host specific

160
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,180
most of the times and most of the range but not so much in other places and they hybridized and outbreak

161
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,820
years. So it was a confusing situation going on. They have different pheromones but a lot of other

162
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:37,100
characteristics. But you know these isolating mechanisms broke down under outbreak conditions.

163
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,900
We made it to the D's. Do you think we should stop now or keep going?

164
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,260
It's probably a good stopping point.

165
00:15:48,940 --> 00:16:00,940
So many different plants. It could be these changes in frequency are due to

166
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:10,380
availability of some of the other hosts and it may be that these different host races are

167
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,900
out competing one another. I don't know. But because it feeds on acorns and oaks

168
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,220
have gotten hammered by the fires that may account for the decline.

169
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,540
He has one. Oliver has one. Oliver has one. I was looking for it now.

170
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,060
We're just going to kind of name moth.

171
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:39,580
Dazipyga alterno squamilla is a much more spectacular moth than its name.

172
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,460
This is one that once you remember the name you don't forget because it's hard to remember the name.

173
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,380
But if you look at pictures it's quite a flashy moth. I think it's on conifers.

174
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:02,060
But Greg got one in his backyard oddly enough. See it has this band here which can be really

175
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:12,380
there may be more pictures down below. So it varies in intensity and often there's this bright streak

176
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,820
through it. So I can't miss it. So they've all been recorded. But there's another Dazipyga that's

177
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:26,140
somewhat similar but not so similar that it could be confused with it. But it's also in California.

178
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,540
And I never got that one. So one Davis record and many

179
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,580
collected and recorded. Anything that's flashy, yeah.

180
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,900
Than something that's drab and small and boring. And it's also more likely to be

181
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,580
identified better because people have described them better.

182
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:54,700
Yeah, I mean that's kind of the danger of harvesting moths from a sheet or even collecting them with a net.

183
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,100
There's a bias.

184
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Your eye is drawn to some species more than others.

185
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,740
You know, I told Greg when he was out there to only collect macros. There's two reasons for that.

186
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:14,860
You know, but partially because he only collected, he focused on the flashy ones and never collected the

187
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,900
boring looking ones. But also he put them all together and a big moth that's

188
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,580
fluttering around will damage the small moths. So I always kept the small ones separate from the big ones when I collect.
