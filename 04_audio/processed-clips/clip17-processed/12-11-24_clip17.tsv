0	2620	All right, we're back.
3620	5340	Do you have anything at 10, Grace?
6320	6880	No.
7220	7560	Me neither.
7680	8260	Something at 11.
8600	9280	Okay, yeah.
9480	12380	Probably need to wrap up by like 10.15 or 10.30.
12680	16900	Cyanoti sabiniai feeds on Pinus sabiniana.
19580	23700	And it's a small one with narrow black wings.
23700	31280	And I've dissected enough of them to know that at least some of them are the species.
31500	36540	So every Cyanotis with small, black, narrow wings I've called sabiniani.
37840	43040	But every species has a similar looking species.
43300	46120	And many of them have species out here.
47920	52920	Trichostola is one of the more common ones in Davis.
52920	68080	And it has dark wings and a characteristic patch at the base of the forewings that you can't see until the wings are extended.
68340	70060	But it's very diagnostic.
71640	77520	And it seems to be fairly common at Davis as well.
77520	84020	But, see, after Herbert disappeared, that may be, you know, fires were very damaging to oaks.
84680	87900	And the last fire seemed to be devastating to oaks.
88180	94580	So I don't know why there's not so many in that span of years.
94840	96500	But there should have been.
96500	100360	Yeah, because the fire was 2015, right?
101360	101680	Yeah.
102000	105940	You know, the other thing that happens is often I put things away to dissect.
106440	109140	And if I don't get around to it, they get misplaced.
109620	112320	And I don't find them again for several years.
112320	124900	So these troublesome genera, for which I do have genitalia, may be underrepresented across the board.
125380	126400	You know, not just this one.
128280	135440	But, you know, once I learned of that character on the wings of Trichostola, I no longer needed to dissect them.
135440	147260	So, that's the problem you face when dealing with work in process, progress.
147940	151640	And it's going to be in progress forever.
154140	163640	Caristinera rosaceana is, I think they call it the oblique-banded leaf roller or something like that.
163640	175440	And it feeds on a broad number of plants, so it's occasionally a garden pest.
175980	178260	But I don't know that it's an economic pest.
180020	187100	And it's fairly easy to recognize, although there is another Tartricid and another genus, which is somewhat similar.
187320	188820	But it seems to come and go.
188820	196340	So, you know, I got it for a few years in my backyard and then one every now and then.
198840	205940	It showed up with greater frequency on Cold Canyon.
205940	219500	And it has a sinuous leading edge of the forewing, which makes it somewhat easy to identify, except that it's not the only Tartricid with that.
219940	223660	And many Tartricids have that similar-looking banded butter.
223980	230320	But I think that all of these are recorded accurately and inclusively.
230320	237600	There's a tour.
238020	238340	Yeah.
238860	239200	Kids.
242340	244320	Carista Stigma Elegantalis.
244320	251320	As well as Carista Zeppirellis.
251940	261800	One of them is yellow and red and fairly, you know, pops on the sheet so you don't forget to collect them.
261800	271760	Where the other one is more of a nondescript looking and brown.
273400	279820	And it seemed that they were more common in the early days of the survey.
279820	288440	They disappeared for a while and then I started getting Zeppirellis again, I think, or Elegantalis.
288440	289420	I can't remember.
290120	297920	Anyway, the flashy-looking one seems to be less common than it used to be.
298000	299960	And the other one kind of came and went.
299960	306560	These are, I think, Cranbids, but they might be Pirellis.
306840	308120	I'm pretty sure they're Cranbids.
310260	311240	Yep, Cranbid.
313660	315500	Celidasis conspecta.
317180	318900	That's a generic change.
319220	325100	Can you call up a picture and then I'll know what it is?
325100	330780	Oh, okay.
331220	332680	Yeah, that's a Nottadonid.
333920	343380	And it was a subspecies of a more widely distributed one until the recent monographs.
347720	355080	And Wagner thought that Miller, who was the first author of the monographs, was a splitter.
356100	362560	And he kept asking me to get a female so that he could rear these.
362840	366820	But, you know, once you start looking for something for Wagner, they seem to disappear.
367360	371100	And so I never got the...
371660	376440	But, you know, I sent him another species that he was interested in.
376460	378920	And he got all the data wrong in the monographs.
379100	381380	So, in a way, I'm glad he didn't get it.
381380	382380	So, I was able to get an unpublished...
382380	383380	I was able to get an unpublished...
383380	387380	I was able to get an unpublished...
387380	388380	I was able to get an unpublished set of...
388380	389380	I was able to get an unpublished...
389380	395380	I was able to get an unpublished...
395380	401780	A genus that has hundreds and hundreds of species.
402320	405940	And most of the Western species did not seem to be described.
405940	418940	So, I was able to get an unpublished set of genital illustrations of all the name species.
418940	424580	And a few of some that had a manuscript name, a name that hadn't been published.
424580	431620	And when I did the dissection, I was only able to match up a couple of them.
433060	434580	Acordella...
434580	438600	I can't remember now.
438860	442300	I've reared this, and it's either on lotus or on willow.
442400	443500	I think it's on lotus.
445000	449360	And coleophoras are like clothes moths.
449360	453680	They make a feeding shelter and crawl around with it.
453680	457520	So, they're like caddisflies in a way, like terrestrial caddisflies.
457520	464520	And then they stick out their head and mine leaves.
464780	470220	And then they attach to the leaf and spin a cocoon.
470220	480220	But what's interesting is they feed from the end attached to the leaves, but they emerge from the other end.
480680	490460	So, at some point, they turn around within that shelter, which is barely bigger than their diameter.
493300	495500	And clothes moths do the same thing.
495500	498900	So, it's kind of interesting that they do that.
500520	503320	Disco striata feeds on ceanothus.
504420	508380	And this was one I was able to match up.
508600	514320	And not only did I match them up, I went to Berkeley and looked at some identified specimens.
515440	523200	And so, both the genitalia and specimens at Berkeley look like this one.
523200	527900	So, these are probably all recorded and all recorded correctly.
528220	530760	Both of these are very similar looking.
531380	537720	But in the preface to that unpublished set of genitalia illustrations,
538600	544920	the authors caution that some species look like other species and you need to dissect them to be sure.
544920	556740	But it's hard to get things published that are small moths that most people don't care very much for.
559340	568200	Condica MRSA was, when I first started the survey, known as Droughtia.
568200	575520	Droughtia, something or other, completely different species, different genus, different species.
577820	588140	I think it may feed on a plant that, I can't think of.
588140	595540	So, Wagner was working on these for a while and he had me send him food plant.
598460	604140	I can't remember the name of it, but it's one of the plants that's down in the stream bed.
605480	610360	Rather than up in the chaparral zone or in the woody areas.
610360	614020	Do you know what it looks like?
615400	616000	Pardon me?
616100	616340	The plant?
616700	619760	Oh, Droughtia Lunata was the former name of this one.
620000	620260	Mm-hmm.
621580	622460	And, uh...
622460	623120	Do you think it's native?
624020	625020	I think so.
627560	633360	And there is another condica called Al...
633360	634360	Al...
634360	635360	Al...
635360	637860	Al something or other.
637860	640080	This is somewhat similar.
641140	651860	And before I realized there were two species, I may have confused some of the less recorded species with, um...
651860	652880	Droughtia Lunata.
653820	656960	This moth has a long flight period.
656960	671420	And that could mean that there's multiple generations or it could mean that it overwinters as an adult or does not lay the eggs till late in the year.
671520	672020	I don't know.
672020	685940	So if any droughtial lunata remain in your database, they should be changed to condica mercy.
685940	697040	Oh, are these black widows?
697040	698040	Oh, my God.
698040	699960	Oh, we can move if you want.
699960	702700	But I think they're coming and going pretty good.
702700	714460	Cosmia Kalami is a Noctua. There was a paper on them recently which may have some information
714460	718540	on whether they're native or not. I think they're native but I don't know for sure.
720700	723980	Fairly easy to recognize. It has a band with a
723980	735100	little wave in it that's consistent and different than you see in any other banded.
737420	743180	There are other species in the genus but this seems to be the only one around here.
743180	746860	And they range in color from almost white to
746860	756300	kind of a soft brown in color. And the band is sometimes contrasting
757100	759820	considerably with the ground the rest of the wing.
761340	767660	Crambus spariolus is a crambus. There are with a white
770060	774300	streak down near the leading edge of the forewing.
774300	782540	As are other crambus species. These are sod moths. They feed in the soil
783500	787420	or the root crown of grasses. And
791820	796860	I suspect they do better in good rain years than in poor rain years but I don't know.
796860	800540	In Davis it disappeared in my yard for a long time and then came back.
800540	810620	I thought it had completely disappeared and had been replaced by the
812860	815100	introduced non-native
818140	820620	lawn moth. But it came back.
820620	831900	Cydia latiferiana is the filbert moth, I think. Am I correct?
833500	836700	I think so. Let's see. Yep. Filbert worm.
838140	842700	Okay. Okay. It's a filbert worm moth is what it is.
842700	855260	The specialist who works on this part of tortrices believes that this is a complex of species
858940	867180	under one name. There's quite a bit of variability and he thinks that what might be going on is that
867180	874940	there's host races that are becoming specialized and by doing so are also
877180	883100	becoming sexually isolated from other host races.
884060	891580	So this may be either a case of host race races that are evolving into species
891580	901100	species or host races which because of the pests are now alongside one another and
902220	907340	merging to become one species. It's hard to know what the direction is going on. You know,
907340	913980	we had the same thing going on with the moss. I studied spruce budworms. They were host specific
914860	921180	most of the times and most of the range but not so much in other places and they hybridized and outbreak
921180	927820	years. So it was a confusing situation going on. They have different pheromones but a lot of other
929100	937100	characteristics. But you know these isolating mechanisms broke down under outbreak conditions.
937100	941900	We made it to the D's. Do you think we should stop now or keep going?
945740	947260	It's probably a good stopping point.
948940	960940	So many different plants. It could be these changes in frequency are due to
960940	970380	availability of some of the other hosts and it may be that these different host races are
972380	977900	out competing one another. I don't know. But because it feeds on acorns and oaks
978460	984220	have gotten hammered by the fires that may account for the decline.
984220	988540	He has one. Oliver has one. Oliver has one. I was looking for it now.
988540	990060	We're just going to kind of name moth.
990060	999580	Dazipyga alterno squamilla is a much more spectacular moth than its name.
1002060	1006460	This is one that once you remember the name you don't forget because it's hard to remember the name.
1007260	1012380	But if you look at pictures it's quite a flashy moth. I think it's on conifers.
1012380	1022060	But Greg got one in his backyard oddly enough. See it has this band here which can be really
1025580	1032380	there may be more pictures down below. So it varies in intensity and often there's this bright streak
1032380	1037820	through it. So I can't miss it. So they've all been recorded. But there's another Dazipyga that's
1037820	1046140	somewhat similar but not so similar that it could be confused with it. But it's also in California.
1046140	1050540	And I never got that one. So one Davis record and many
1053100	1055580	collected and recorded. Anything that's flashy, yeah.
1055580	1061900	Than something that's drab and small and boring. And it's also more likely to be
1061900	1065580	identified better because people have described them better.
1065580	1074700	Yeah, I mean that's kind of the danger of harvesting moths from a sheet or even collecting them with a net.
1074700	1075100	There's a bias.
1075100	1079100	Your eye is drawn to some species more than others.
1079980	1085740	You know, I told Greg when he was out there to only collect macros. There's two reasons for that.
1085740	1094860	You know, but partially because he only collected, he focused on the flashy ones and never collected the
1096060	1099900	boring looking ones. But also he put them all together and a big moth that's
1100940	1107580	fluttering around will damage the small moths. So I always kept the small ones separate from the big ones when I collect.
