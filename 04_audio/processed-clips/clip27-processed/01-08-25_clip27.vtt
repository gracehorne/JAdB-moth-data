00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Telfuza sedulatilla. We talked about this before. This is a Gallicaea that feeds on oak and you know

00:10.200 --> 00:16.560
you collect oaks in the spring and you get without seeing the larvae and you get adults will come out

00:16.560 --> 00:23.340
of a collection of it. And I reared it from live oak but I think it feeds on other. And as I

00:23.340 --> 00:29.120
mentioned there's some black individuals which are larger that Powell said are a different species

00:29.120 --> 00:33.800
and whether it has a name or not I don't know but I've recorded them separately but I'm not certain

00:33.800 --> 00:41.720
that all of them are a different species or that any of them are a different species. So how you

00:41.720 --> 00:53.480
treat the ones I list as Telfuza black may affect your analyses. But the black ones after the fire

00:53.480 --> 01:05.780
and was it 2016 the one before that? 2015. In 2017 or 2018 the black ones were very common, more common

01:05.780 --> 01:14.600
than I'd seen them before. So maybe that means something maybe not you know because everything

01:14.600 --> 01:20.420
was black and ashy after the fire. But it also could be that it is a different species and it feeds on

01:20.420 --> 01:26.420
something that something that was released from competition after the fire. So the food plant

01:26.420 --> 01:36.500
became more common but I couldn't say. Telenola polygyra is not common at Cold Cannon. It's very common in my

01:36.500 --> 01:46.660
backyard and Wagner says it feeds on leaf litter but I'll take his word for it. Tetrasis servanera. Tetrasis is a

01:46.660 --> 01:55.700
difficult genus. It went on in a different name before and there was a revision by Ferris the same

01:55.700 --> 02:03.380
guy who did the Eupatesia. And it seems to be a pretty good job. Servanera is the one that flies early

02:03.380 --> 02:09.380
in the year and the other two species we have there fly later in the year. It's possible that some are

02:09.380 --> 02:15.940
misidentified. Herceteria is one of the other species and I can't remember what the third one is.

02:18.500 --> 02:28.260
Tenea pelminella is the teneid. These look like the common teneid but so do a lot of other teneas. So this

02:28.260 --> 02:37.300
this is the the closed moth pelminella. That's the one that if you have anything made of wool and

02:37.300 --> 02:45.540
Davis will find it and eat it. Tulipi distincta. This is a weird moth. It's in the

02:45.540 --> 02:57.140
the um the family not it begins with L. Lasiocampid. Lasiocampid. Yeah. So lots of veins on the

02:57.140 --> 03:06.500
forewing and there's a farm that's short wing with a long but has the same abdomen and that one I got it

03:06.500 --> 03:19.140
like one time. And distincta is a name that's been given to a lot of different looking populations. And

03:21.460 --> 03:28.660
whether this is the correct name for it or not but it seems like this is a family that needs to be

03:28.660 --> 03:43.780
revisited and worked on especially now that DNA is possible. Taurapalpis chavalis is a I think it's a

03:43.780 --> 03:52.180
Fisotime pyralum but it might be on a different group of pyroloids and it feeds on Iriogonum.

03:58.660 --> 04:09.300
And you can spot the caterpillars make a lot of webbing when they feed so they're easily detected

04:10.660 --> 04:16.420
and fairly easily to rear. Trichopolia alfkenii we have in Davis and

04:18.180 --> 04:22.980
recent generic change so I think it may be

04:22.980 --> 04:30.420
be under a different name and certainly under a different name in the first. It used to be prot or 30s.

04:33.220 --> 04:33.540
And

04:33.540 --> 04:42.020
Trifosa californiata. There's two species of Trifosa out in Cold Canyon. The other one is called

04:42.740 --> 04:49.700
Haesitata h-a-e s-i-t-a-t-a and that's a much larger moth. So

04:52.660 --> 04:58.020
this species is the one that looks like Trifosa,

04:58.740 --> 05:03.280
like California neoalsis. Oh yeah. But this flies

05:03.280 --> 05:10.100
early in the year and neoalsis flies later in the year and I don't know the food plant but

05:10.100 --> 05:12.800
but they may both feed on the same thing.

05:12.860 --> 05:13.400
I'm not sure.

05:15.880 --> 05:20.020
Eudea profundalis is, I think it has a common name.

05:20.020 --> 05:27.640
I'd say a crambine, and I think it feeds on, are you looking it up?

05:29.020 --> 05:36.080
It might be like the sugar beet moth or false sugar beet moth or something like that.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.920
It doesn't give me a name.

05:40.100 --> 05:46.860
This is one that's often kicked up during the day.

05:47.340 --> 05:54.580
I don't know whether these collection records are indicative of its abundance.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.860
I don't know, you know, because I can kick it up during the day

05:59.860 --> 06:02.680
and never see it at light for long periods of time.

06:02.680 --> 06:09.440
It looks a little bit like a kyra, except longer palpy,

06:09.440 --> 06:16.200
but pyra is, you know, if you look at them just casually, they're difficult to tell apart.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.240
And there are other species of Eudea that are similar to this.

06:21.240 --> 06:33.260
And there is a paper on Eudea that makes it much easier to identify than many of the others.

06:33.260 --> 06:37.780
Okay. Blastobases.

06:38.220 --> 06:43.740
In the beginning, I tried to sort them out by general appearance,

06:43.840 --> 06:48.300
and I called them species 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then finally I just threw up my hands.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.420
So that's why there's no early records.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.820
I called them 1, 2, or 3, or 4.

06:52.820 --> 06:57.160
And then later, after the fire, I decided to try to sort them again.

06:57.380 --> 07:04.780
But all of the blastobases other than glandulae should be lumped together as blastobases.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.520
Spuh, or spuh, but.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.620
Species are species.

07:11.580 --> 07:15.260
Viridiceptus marinae, this used to be in Eligia.

07:15.260 --> 07:24.440
And it turned out, it turns out that all of our Eligia are not Eligia.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.400
And this is one of the few species which has been assigned to a genus.

07:29.100 --> 07:36.080
And it seems to have some relationship to Aseptus, which we covered earlier.

07:36.080 --> 07:47.780
And it seemed to have declined for a while and then reappeared.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.800
But I think it's more common down on the lower trail.

07:51.640 --> 07:59.060
And it may be that the decline was due to my moving up to the upper trail later.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.560
There are, you know, another species that was more common that we covered last week

08:04.560 --> 08:08.380
on that lower trail was the Hesperumia sulforaria.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.800
So I don't see it as much on the upper trail.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.820
Vichula seratilinella.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.540
This used to be a subspecies of Edmunds eye.

08:25.540 --> 08:42.180
And whether this is a valid species or not, I don't know if the DNA evidence supports it.

08:42.300 --> 08:51.420
The only difference between it and Edmunds eye is this one has the grayness of the hind wing, I think.

08:51.420 --> 09:00.540
But it's kind of a difficult physitine to recognize, whether they're all recorded or not.

09:00.780 --> 09:04.780
I think this one gets into honeybee eyes, among other things.

09:05.260 --> 09:10.500
But it's known to be a pest of dried fruits and a number of other things.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.620
So caterpillars apparently have a sweet tooth.

09:14.620 --> 09:21.000
Walshia mysticolorella is a Cosmopter rigid.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.140
It's the larvae feed internally.

09:26.320 --> 09:31.880
And I know it from feeding in stems of woody lupins.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.420
But I think it feeds in some other plants as well.

09:37.300 --> 09:41.120
Reasonably common, reasonably easy to identify.

09:41.120 --> 09:49.080
I got once in Davis, Xenolechia stasper.

09:49.180 --> 09:56.800
This is a manuscript name that Hopper used for one of his oak feeding species.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.260
We're getting to the end here.

10:00.420 --> 10:00.760
Hooray.

10:00.760 --> 10:05.380
And I quit using this name.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.920
So they didn't abruptly disappear.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.180
I just quit using it.

10:09.800 --> 10:19.060
And I think it would be best to lump stasper and quercifaga as together.

10:20.060 --> 10:27.260
And how many species there are then under that name, I couldn't say.

10:27.260 --> 10:39.360
But I didn't have a good grasp of what stasper and quercifaga looked like.

10:40.400 --> 10:45.760
And I thought that stasper were the darker looking moths.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.880
But it's so variable that I don't know that you can tell them apart from one another.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.200
And I don't know if Hopper's work.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.640
It probably has genitalia or illustrated or something.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.080
But I haven't seen it.

11:01.340 --> 11:01.640
Okay.

11:01.940 --> 11:03.740
Zespia infomatis.

11:03.740 --> 11:17.140
There's one called finitimus, which was described by LaFontaine.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.500
And then he also said there's hybrids.

11:20.620 --> 11:26.780
And I sorted them out on the basis of what I thought they were.

11:26.780 --> 11:38.120
But now that I've seen pictures on the internet, I'm not sure that the ones I identified as hybrids are different than...

11:38.120 --> 11:40.220
I don't know that they are the hybrids.

11:40.320 --> 11:48.440
And I don't know that what I've called finitimus or whatever the anagram of infomatis is are that species.

11:48.440 --> 12:00.300
So those Zespia identifications are questionable.

12:00.780 --> 12:04.540
And whether they really are different species or not remains to be seen.

12:07.540 --> 12:14.680
LaFontaine, in his paper, said that the hybrids are sterile.

12:14.680 --> 12:19.920
So the females were never mated there.

12:21.700 --> 12:27.680
So that would suggest that they are good species.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.340
But I don't know if there's any DNA work or not.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.580
As I said, LaFontaine's a splitter.

12:34.780 --> 12:41.080
Ipsilofa cervella looks like Ipsilofa, the other species of Ipsilofa.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.400
This one feeds on oak.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
They spin down.

12:44.520 --> 12:49.680
They have caterpillars that wiggle frantically when disturbed.

12:50.220 --> 12:55.480
And they make a very characteristic cocoon.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.400
It's kind of like a...

12:58.320 --> 13:00.080
It looks like a taco, sort of.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.620
It's attenuated on each end.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.000
Very, very common.

13:06.280 --> 13:17.960
But because they spin down from the oaks, which they feed on, you often see the caterpillars on different plants, which they aren't really feeding on.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.340
They just happen to land there.

13:19.340 --> 13:30.900
So there could be erroneous host plant records for this species when it was really just a pre-pupil larvae spinning down.

13:30.900 --> 13:31.900
So...

13:31.900 --> 13:32.900
So...

13:32.900 --> 13:38.060
Zelleria heimbackeye, I think, is one that feeds on conifers.

13:38.060 --> 13:46.120
So the conifer at Cold Canyon is Sabiniana, Pinus Sabiniana.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.120
Zelleria semitincta.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
Zelleria semitincta.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.120
Zelleria semitincta.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
Zelleria semitincta.

13:54.120 --> 13:59.120
This feeds on Ash phraxonus.

14:00.260 --> 14:05.080
And there's two ash species at Cold Canyon.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.680
And for a long time, we couldn't identify this.

14:07.680 --> 14:19.120
But it turned out that it appears to be the same species that feeds on what they call, I think, chaparral olive or something like that.

14:19.120 --> 14:26.080
which so it's in the Central Valley and then into Arizona and I think this

14:26.080 --> 14:31.040
species was described from Arizona or somewhere but that seems to be all the

14:31.040 --> 14:39.520
same species but for the longest time we thought this was a new species but and

14:39.520 --> 14:46.920
the one enormous ash tree which I think was organ ash vanished I can't find it

14:46.920 --> 14:53.700
anymore and I don't know whether it actually just whether I just can't find

14:53.700 --> 15:00.600
it or whether disappeared on a fire or what but you know Wagner was interested

15:00.600 --> 15:04.740
in ash because of emerald ash borer and he thinks that species are going to go

15:04.740 --> 15:11.100
extinct because of that Xenophleps ligno colorilla is a fairly easy to

15:11.100 --> 15:19.860
identify moth and I think we get it from late fall to through spring there

15:19.860 --> 15:24.420
might even be other generations I haven't looked at that have to look at the

15:24.420 --> 15:30.480
collection records but most records I think are from fall and then again in

15:30.480 --> 15:35.340
spring and I think it's just one generation that over winners but I'm not

15:35.340 --> 15:46.500
certain about that and it's ten o'clock do you finish that was the last thanks John

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
that's awesome
