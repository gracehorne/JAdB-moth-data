0	10200	Telfuza sedulatilla. We talked about this before. This is a Gallicaea that feeds on oak and you know
10200	16560	you collect oaks in the spring and you get without seeing the larvae and you get adults will come out
16560	23340	of a collection of it. And I reared it from live oak but I think it feeds on other. And as I
23340	29120	mentioned there's some black individuals which are larger that Powell said are a different species
29120	33800	and whether it has a name or not I don't know but I've recorded them separately but I'm not certain
33800	41720	that all of them are a different species or that any of them are a different species. So how you
41720	53480	treat the ones I list as Telfuza black may affect your analyses. But the black ones after the fire
53480	65780	and was it 2016 the one before that? 2015. In 2017 or 2018 the black ones were very common, more common
65780	74600	than I'd seen them before. So maybe that means something maybe not you know because everything
74600	80420	was black and ashy after the fire. But it also could be that it is a different species and it feeds on
80420	86420	something that something that was released from competition after the fire. So the food plant
86420	96500	became more common but I couldn't say. Telenola polygyra is not common at Cold Cannon. It's very common in my
96500	106660	backyard and Wagner says it feeds on leaf litter but I'll take his word for it. Tetrasis servanera. Tetrasis is a
106660	115700	difficult genus. It went on in a different name before and there was a revision by Ferris the same
115700	123380	guy who did the Eupatesia. And it seems to be a pretty good job. Servanera is the one that flies early
123380	129380	in the year and the other two species we have there fly later in the year. It's possible that some are
129380	135940	misidentified. Herceteria is one of the other species and I can't remember what the third one is.
138500	148260	Tenea pelminella is the teneid. These look like the common teneid but so do a lot of other teneas. So this
148260	157300	this is the the closed moth pelminella. That's the one that if you have anything made of wool and
157300	165540	Davis will find it and eat it. Tulipi distincta. This is a weird moth. It's in the
165540	177140	the um the family not it begins with L. Lasiocampid. Lasiocampid. Yeah. So lots of veins on the
177140	186500	forewing and there's a farm that's short wing with a long but has the same abdomen and that one I got it
186500	199140	like one time. And distincta is a name that's been given to a lot of different looking populations. And
201460	208660	whether this is the correct name for it or not but it seems like this is a family that needs to be
208660	223780	revisited and worked on especially now that DNA is possible. Taurapalpis chavalis is a I think it's a
223780	232180	Fisotime pyralum but it might be on a different group of pyroloids and it feeds on Iriogonum.
238660	249300	And you can spot the caterpillars make a lot of webbing when they feed so they're easily detected
250660	256420	and fairly easily to rear. Trichopolia alfkenii we have in Davis and
258180	262980	recent generic change so I think it may be
262980	270420	be under a different name and certainly under a different name in the first. It used to be prot or 30s.
273220	273540	And
273540	282020	Trifosa californiata. There's two species of Trifosa out in Cold Canyon. The other one is called
282740	289700	Haesitata h-a-e s-i-t-a-t-a and that's a much larger moth. So
292660	298020	this species is the one that looks like Trifosa,
298740	303280	like California neoalsis. Oh yeah. But this flies
303280	310100	early in the year and neoalsis flies later in the year and I don't know the food plant but
310100	312800	but they may both feed on the same thing.
312860	313400	I'm not sure.
315880	320020	Eudea profundalis is, I think it has a common name.
320020	327640	I'd say a crambine, and I think it feeds on, are you looking it up?
329020	336080	It might be like the sugar beet moth or false sugar beet moth or something like that.
337260	338920	It doesn't give me a name.
340100	346860	This is one that's often kicked up during the day.
347340	354580	I don't know whether these collection records are indicative of its abundance.
354840	359860	I don't know, you know, because I can kick it up during the day
359860	362680	and never see it at light for long periods of time.
362680	369440	It looks a little bit like a kyra, except longer palpy,
369440	376200	but pyra is, you know, if you look at them just casually, they're difficult to tell apart.
376200	381240	And there are other species of Eudea that are similar to this.
381240	393260	And there is a paper on Eudea that makes it much easier to identify than many of the others.
393260	397780	Okay. Blastobases.
398220	403740	In the beginning, I tried to sort them out by general appearance,
403840	408300	and I called them species 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then finally I just threw up my hands.
408540	410420	So that's why there's no early records.
411060	412820	I called them 1, 2, or 3, or 4.
412820	417160	And then later, after the fire, I decided to try to sort them again.
417380	424780	But all of the blastobases other than glandulae should be lumped together as blastobases.
426860	428520	Spuh, or spuh, but.
429420	430620	Species are species.
431580	435260	Viridiceptus marinae, this used to be in Eligia.
435260	444440	And it turned out, it turns out that all of our Eligia are not Eligia.
444640	448400	And this is one of the few species which has been assigned to a genus.
449100	456080	And it seems to have some relationship to Aseptus, which we covered earlier.
456080	467780	And it seemed to have declined for a while and then reappeared.
468160	470800	But I think it's more common down on the lower trail.
471640	479060	And it may be that the decline was due to my moving up to the upper trail later.
480800	484560	There are, you know, another species that was more common that we covered last week
484560	488380	on that lower trail was the Hesperumia sulforaria.
489060	491800	So I don't see it as much on the upper trail.
495180	497820	Vichula seratilinella.
501600	505540	This used to be a subspecies of Edmunds eye.
505540	522180	And whether this is a valid species or not, I don't know if the DNA evidence supports it.
522300	531420	The only difference between it and Edmunds eye is this one has the grayness of the hind wing, I think.
531420	540540	But it's kind of a difficult physitine to recognize, whether they're all recorded or not.
540780	544780	I think this one gets into honeybee eyes, among other things.
545260	550500	But it's known to be a pest of dried fruits and a number of other things.
550920	554620	So caterpillars apparently have a sweet tooth.
554620	561000	Walshia mysticolorella is a Cosmopter rigid.
562260	565140	It's the larvae feed internally.
566320	571880	And I know it from feeding in stems of woody lupins.
572720	576420	But I think it feeds in some other plants as well.
577300	581120	Reasonably common, reasonably easy to identify.
581120	589080	I got once in Davis, Xenolechia stasper.
589180	596800	This is a manuscript name that Hopper used for one of his oak feeding species.
598620	600260	We're getting to the end here.
600420	600760	Hooray.
600760	605380	And I quit using this name.
606080	607920	So they didn't abruptly disappear.
608160	609180	I just quit using it.
609800	619060	And I think it would be best to lump stasper and quercifaga as together.
620060	627260	And how many species there are then under that name, I couldn't say.
627260	639360	But I didn't have a good grasp of what stasper and quercifaga looked like.
640400	645760	And I thought that stasper were the darker looking moths.
645760	650880	But it's so variable that I don't know that you can tell them apart from one another.
651240	654200	And I don't know if Hopper's work.
654280	657640	It probably has genitalia or illustrated or something.
657760	659080	But I haven't seen it.
661340	661640	Okay.
661940	663740	Zespia infomatis.
663740	677140	There's one called finitimus, which was described by LaFontaine.
677620	679500	And then he also said there's hybrids.
680620	686780	And I sorted them out on the basis of what I thought they were.
686780	698120	But now that I've seen pictures on the internet, I'm not sure that the ones I identified as hybrids are different than...
698120	700220	I don't know that they are the hybrids.
700320	708440	And I don't know that what I've called finitimus or whatever the anagram of infomatis is are that species.
708440	720300	So those Zespia identifications are questionable.
720780	724540	And whether they really are different species or not remains to be seen.
727540	734680	LaFontaine, in his paper, said that the hybrids are sterile.
734680	739920	So the females were never mated there.
741700	747680	So that would suggest that they are good species.
747800	750340	But I don't know if there's any DNA work or not.
751560	753580	As I said, LaFontaine's a splitter.
754780	761080	Ipsilofa cervella looks like Ipsilofa, the other species of Ipsilofa.
762080	763400	This one feeds on oak.
763400	764400	They spin down.
764520	769680	They have caterpillars that wiggle frantically when disturbed.
770220	775480	And they make a very characteristic cocoon.
776220	777400	It's kind of like a...
778320	780080	It looks like a taco, sort of.
781440	783620	It's attenuated on each end.
783620	786000	Very, very common.
786280	797960	But because they spin down from the oaks, which they feed on, you often see the caterpillars on different plants, which they aren't really feeding on.
798040	799340	They just happen to land there.
799340	810900	So there could be erroneous host plant records for this species when it was really just a pre-pupil larvae spinning down.
810900	811900	So...
811900	812900	So...
812900	818060	Zelleria heimbackeye, I think, is one that feeds on conifers.
818060	826120	So the conifer at Cold Canyon is Sabiniana, Pinus Sabiniana.
826120	828120	Zelleria semitincta.
828120	829120	Zelleria semitincta.
829120	833120	Zelleria semitincta.
833120	834120	Zelleria semitincta.
834120	839120	This feeds on Ash phraxonus.
840260	845080	And there's two ash species at Cold Canyon.
845080	847680	And for a long time, we couldn't identify this.
847680	859120	But it turned out that it appears to be the same species that feeds on what they call, I think, chaparral olive or something like that.
859120	866080	which so it's in the Central Valley and then into Arizona and I think this
866080	871040	species was described from Arizona or somewhere but that seems to be all the
871040	879520	same species but for the longest time we thought this was a new species but and
879520	886920	the one enormous ash tree which I think was organ ash vanished I can't find it
886920	893700	anymore and I don't know whether it actually just whether I just can't find
893700	900600	it or whether disappeared on a fire or what but you know Wagner was interested
900600	904740	in ash because of emerald ash borer and he thinks that species are going to go
904740	911100	extinct because of that Xenophleps ligno colorilla is a fairly easy to
911100	919860	identify moth and I think we get it from late fall to through spring there
919860	924420	might even be other generations I haven't looked at that have to look at the
924420	930480	collection records but most records I think are from fall and then again in
930480	935340	spring and I think it's just one generation that over winners but I'm not
935340	946500	certain about that and it's ten o'clock do you finish that was the last thanks John
946500	948500	that's awesome
