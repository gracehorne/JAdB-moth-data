0	10140	Okay. Me, I mean. Yes, we did stop. Okay, we're going to start with Uzoa. Uzoa is a big genus,
10400	22380	and it was revised by LaFontaine in Canada, and he published most of it in a single volume of
22380	30560	Molls of North America, you know, the Mona series, and then a few others were in a subsequent volume
30560	38680	that he added later on. It's a big genus. A lot of the species are very similar to one another,
39740	43980	and LaFontaine is a splitter, so. No.
43980	53480	Oh. It has been the experience of myself and others who have sent him photographs
53480	61420	that he will provide you a name which doesn't match the pictures in his volume, so.
62220	66880	When I have done dissections, though, I've been able to figure things out.
66880	76440	So, the common one in Davis is called Septentria dalis, and that one has many similar-looking
76440	83620	species, and I'm slowly beginning to figure out how to tell them apart without doing dissections,
84220	92420	and we don't get that so often at Cold Canyon, and the only ones, I guess, that made your criteria
92420	97980	were this one called Brunigera, and I got that name from Ron Robertson, who identified most
97980	108040	of the noctuids in the beginning. But subsequently, I got a name of M. Fausta from Tim McCabe, who's
108040	119860	in Albany, New York, and he, too, is a noctuid specialist. So, they're similar-looking species.
119860	123220	I could have one or both under this name.
124220	128460	So, you're talking about all the euzo are like that?
128620	135360	No, just Brunigera and M. Fausta. It could be either species or both. I think that they're
135360	141040	probably Brunigera. Ron Robertson was really good, and, you know, he was self-trained. He
141040	147680	was just an excellent biologist. All of a sudden, he quit working on moths and started working
147680	150680	on lichens, you know, of all things.
154040	159340	Takoyi is a little bit more easily recognized.
160440	161820	Is this likely to be native?
164040	165100	I don't know.
165380	165580	Okay.
166620	172440	Most of these things, I don't know. And then there's a question about definition of native,
172440	181900	native, because they could be native, but they may not be reproducing in Cold Canyon or in
181900	189000	Davis. And euzo is one of those generally, which has a number of species which are known
189000	192380	to, I don't know if you'd call it migration or just dispersal.
192380	200420	But some of them require specialized habitats, like the larvae are in sand dune vegetation,
200860	207820	and they make their chrysalis or their cocoons under the sandy soil.
209540	216080	But a lot of them are just generalists and widespread. Most of them feed on trees and shrubs.
216080	220920	And I don't know if they're specialists or not.
223860	229240	Probably the monograph will have some information on known food plants.
229460	234260	But again, whether that's all the food plants or not, I couldn't tell you.
234260	234820	Okay.
238500	244460	Eusophora semifuneralis is a physitine pyralid.
245880	253560	It has a common name like peach or plum borer or something like that.
253940	259380	And there is a similar looking species that has been reported from this area, but I don't
259380	264880	know whether those are erroneous identifications or not.
265520	270940	And curiously, even though this is a known pest species, I've only got it once in my yard.
272100	279020	And this is one alleged pest species which seems to be more common at Cold Canyon and far more
279020	280960	common at Cold Canyon than in Davis.
282460	284720	And I have pluot, you know, which is a plum.
284720	288200	And my neighbor had a plum even before I planted my pluot.
288200	292440	So, strange thing.
294260	305260	Feralia februalis is a very attractive, mottled, kind of reticulate pattern, green and white
305260	309700	noctua with black scale in a swill.
309700	316320	And allegedly, there are two species going under this name.
316440	317860	One is darker than the other.
318260	319620	And there's some variability.
321260	325620	And occasionally, you find specimens where the green is replaced by orange.
327280	334480	And, in fact, if you put them in a relaxer with certain chemicals in it, the green will
334480	335520	turn to orange.
335520	344220	So, it could be an environmental thing or it could be food plant affects the color of
344220	347140	the, what is normally green.
347380	351380	But I've never seen orange ones from Cold Canyon.
351900	354220	And I've never seen the moth in Davis.
354220	364080	I don't know the food plant, but I think it's kind of a generalist on trees and shrubs.
365080	365700	Talk to it.
370200	371880	Phylatoma or phylaetema.
373940	375160	Many species.
376060	378100	There's not very good literature.
378220	379560	It needs revision.
379560	384800	You know, there was, this is similar looking to kyanotis.
384900	390720	You can tell the males at the generic level very easily because they have some secondary
390720	396580	scales on the hindwing, androconial scales on the hindwing.
397440	399000	They call them curtain scales.
399140	400700	So, if you look at them upside down.
400980	404740	And then if you look at the tip of the abdomen, you can also see some characters.
404740	407240	But the females are a little bit harder.
408240	416520	And Wagner believes that shiny scales on the top of the abdomen are sufficient to tell them
416520	425180	apart from the similar looking general, which would be kyanotis, aroga, and bryotropa, among
425180	425660	others.
425660	432320	There's, these are the ones that the wings are overlapping and flat on top of the body
432320	436900	instead of tent-like or pitched roof-like.
436900	451460	Fercula cynaroides was lumped with another species called cynaria for a while.
451460	454380	And it was removed.
455640	461140	It was, the status was changed in the recent monograph on not-a-dotted moth.
461140	471760	And Wagner, who was co-author of the monograph, says that Miller, who was the first author, was
471760	472300	a splitter.
473040	481060	So, I don't know whether DNA studies were done on these, but this one, I think, feeds on
481060	481580	willows.
481580	493180	And, um, it looks almost identical to cynaria and a couple of other former subspecies that
493180	495000	were elevated in the monograph.
495700	502060	But it's, regardless of the name, it's all one species, probably native.
502740	508780	And then, when it's included with all the things that used to be subspecies, it's transcontinental.
511580	517420	And, um, Galleria melanella is the greater wax moth, and we discussed that previously.
518620	527240	And I have stumbled across, um, honeybee hives or honeybee nests at Cull Canyon from time
527240	527680	to time.
527860	533620	So there are some, uh, wild honeybee populations.
533620	544880	So they're not just coming out of, uh, apiary, uh, you know, agricultural honeybee colonies.
548080	555120	Givira Marga is a, what's the family now?
555120	563080	Look it up, and you can get the family.
564280	564960	Cossidae.
565160	565920	Yeah, cossids.
567820	571780	Cossids are borers for the most part.
572220	579300	And, um, sometimes get into infections, but often are primary borers.
579300	587040	And I don't know too much about Givira Marga, but, you know, the prionnix is a big cossid.
587140	588260	This is a small one.
589860	597300	And the abdomen is disproportionately long when compared to the wingspan.
598140	599580	So it's fairly easy.
599640	601300	And then the antennae are very short.
601440	605120	So it's a strange-looking moth and easy to recognize.
605120	614440	And whether the specific name is correct or not is up for debate.
614580	616060	It hasn't been resolved yet.
617020	626220	But, um, this is what we, Greg and I, primarily have decided to call the local Givira.
626220	645800	Hemeraplanis Historialis, um, it's a, now in the, um, what was split off from Noctuids?
646380	646820	Aribid?
647120	647560	Pardon me?
647780	648260	Aribid?
648560	648820	Yeah.
650820	655140	I haven't talked moth in three weeks, and I'm losing it.
656220	662040	Um, and, uh, it looks very much like a geometric and easily confusing.
662560	666520	When I first collected these, you know, I showed them to Powell and showed them to other people.
666620	667980	They couldn't come up with the name.
668060	671540	And then finally when it came up, and then I couldn't remember the name.
671540	686040	Um, but all of them are recorded, and, um, it used to be that I couldn't, we were calling them species Finitima, F-I-N-I-T-I-M-A, in the beginning.
686040	689780	Um, so in the early spreadsheets, you may see that name.
691120	697400	Um, but I couldn't tell it apart from this species, and then eventually they were all lumped under this name, so.
699060	701420	It took care of that identity crisis.
701420	707720	This is Henricus Ambrosana, we talked about in Davis.
708020	712020	It's, uh, tortures from Oaks.
714020	725560	In a, uh, subfamily, Coccolini, that's, uh, currently being revised, but one of the authors, uh, passed away.
725560	728200	So, the revision may be less.
728660	742980	By the way, that person who wrote the San Joaquin Valley Moth, uh, was the single fatality in a auto accident, not, in October or November.
743240	745280	So, he's no longer with us.
745580	747020	Oh, the thing that you reviewed?
747420	747680	Yeah.
747800	748500	Oh, no.
748500	758040	He had been under care for some health conditions, so whether that contributed to the auto accident.
758040	758620	Oh, that's awful.
759360	762240	But, you know, it was kind of shocking.
762480	769420	And, you know, I'm at the age where driving is scary, so when I hear things like that, it's, just rattles me.
769900	770820	Plus, I liked him.
770880	773160	He was a good friend.
773400	773960	I'm sorry.
774200	774640	That sucks.
775780	777380	Hesperumia sulforaria.
777380	787240	Um, this is a geometric yellow, but, um, varying amounts of black on the forewing.
787720	796440	I've got it once in Davis, and I think it feeds on, um, adenostoma, but I'm not certain about that.
797540	803680	And there is a second species, which can be confused with this.
803680	809280	And for the longest time, I had no records of it, and then I got two of this similar species.
810120	813540	And I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.
813540	830580	But the similar species generally has, uh, considerably, well, a wide, somewhat wide, I should say, uh, black margin to the wings.
830580	844500	And, uh, I thought that it wasn't, that other species was not here, but Mariah reported it from McLaughlin.
844500	852740	And then when I looked at her specimens, I said, oh, and then not too long after that, I got a couple of specimens at Cold Canyon.
852740	864560	But it's conceivable that some of the earlier records were misidentified, because previously I had called them all the other species, and then had a change of heart.
864560	883400	So, um, there's another character, too, the dot, they call it the, there's a, um, spot in the disco cell of the four wings, and that, um, differs between the two species, but not 100% reliable.
883400	889180	Homeosoma, homeosoma, electellus, and Davis, we talked about it.
889240	892180	This is sometimes called the sunflower moth, or something.
892480	897280	So, I think it feeds on seeds of a number of, uh, composites.
898740	907040	And likely native, the ones in California look different than the ones in other parts of its, uh, its range.
907040	913220	Uh, and as I mentioned before, the ones that are gray,
913400	934860	rather than this kind of shiny, uh, tan color may be misidentified oslorellum, or, um, yet another species of, so there's some, but that's, it, nonetheless, it by far is the most common homeosoma in, uh, our area.
938120	941120	Home orthodes communis, um,
941120	943740	Um, I don't know much about it.
943740	950240	Um, I think they're all identified correctly.
951360	954800	Home ortho, these are noctuas, home orthodes hanami.
955160	963120	The ones out here have a subspecies name, and they don't look like hanami from other parts of the range, but, um,
963120	969960	they're easy, you know, once you recognize them, they're fairly easy to identify.
969960	970300	All right.
970500	970980	Thank you.
970980	972580	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
986580	996180	Mr.
