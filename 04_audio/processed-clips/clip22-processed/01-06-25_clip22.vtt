WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.140
Okay. Me, I mean. Yes, we did stop. Okay, we're going to start with Uzoa. Uzoa is a big genus,

00:10.400 --> 00:22.380
and it was revised by LaFontaine in Canada, and he published most of it in a single volume of

00:22.380 --> 00:30.560
Molls of North America, you know, the Mona series, and then a few others were in a subsequent volume

00:30.560 --> 00:38.680
that he added later on. It's a big genus. A lot of the species are very similar to one another,

00:39.740 --> 00:43.980
and LaFontaine is a splitter, so. No.

00:43.980 --> 00:53.480
Oh. It has been the experience of myself and others who have sent him photographs

00:53.480 --> 01:01.420
that he will provide you a name which doesn't match the pictures in his volume, so.

01:02.220 --> 01:06.880
When I have done dissections, though, I've been able to figure things out.

01:06.880 --> 01:16.440
So, the common one in Davis is called Septentria dalis, and that one has many similar-looking

01:16.440 --> 01:23.620
species, and I'm slowly beginning to figure out how to tell them apart without doing dissections,

01:24.220 --> 01:32.420
and we don't get that so often at Cold Canyon, and the only ones, I guess, that made your criteria

01:32.420 --> 01:37.980
were this one called Brunigera, and I got that name from Ron Robertson, who identified most

01:37.980 --> 01:48.040
of the noctuids in the beginning. But subsequently, I got a name of M. Fausta from Tim McCabe, who's

01:48.040 --> 01:59.860
in Albany, New York, and he, too, is a noctuid specialist. So, they're similar-looking species.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.220
I could have one or both under this name.

02:04.220 --> 02:08.460
So, you're talking about all the euzo are like that?

02:08.620 --> 02:15.360
No, just Brunigera and M. Fausta. It could be either species or both. I think that they're

02:15.360 --> 02:21.040
probably Brunigera. Ron Robertson was really good, and, you know, he was self-trained. He

02:21.040 --> 02:27.680
was just an excellent biologist. All of a sudden, he quit working on moths and started working

02:27.680 --> 02:30.680
on lichens, you know, of all things.

02:34.040 --> 02:39.340
Takoyi is a little bit more easily recognized.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.820
Is this likely to be native?

02:44.040 --> 02:45.100
I don't know.

02:45.380 --> 02:45.580
Okay.

02:46.620 --> 02:52.440
Most of these things, I don't know. And then there's a question about definition of native,

02:52.440 --> 03:01.900
native, because they could be native, but they may not be reproducing in Cold Canyon or in

03:01.900 --> 03:09.000
Davis. And euzo is one of those generally, which has a number of species which are known

03:09.000 --> 03:12.380
to, I don't know if you'd call it migration or just dispersal.

03:12.380 --> 03:20.420
But some of them require specialized habitats, like the larvae are in sand dune vegetation,

03:20.860 --> 03:27.820
and they make their chrysalis or their cocoons under the sandy soil.

03:29.540 --> 03:36.080
But a lot of them are just generalists and widespread. Most of them feed on trees and shrubs.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.920
And I don't know if they're specialists or not.

03:43.860 --> 03:49.240
Probably the monograph will have some information on known food plants.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.260
But again, whether that's all the food plants or not, I couldn't tell you.

03:54.260 --> 03:54.820
Okay.

03:58.500 --> 04:04.460
Eusophora semifuneralis is a physitine pyralid.

04:05.880 --> 04:13.560
It has a common name like peach or plum borer or something like that.

04:13.940 --> 04:19.380
And there is a similar looking species that has been reported from this area, but I don't

04:19.380 --> 04:24.880
know whether those are erroneous identifications or not.

04:25.520 --> 04:30.940
And curiously, even though this is a known pest species, I've only got it once in my yard.

04:32.100 --> 04:39.020
And this is one alleged pest species which seems to be more common at Cold Canyon and far more

04:39.020 --> 04:40.960
common at Cold Canyon than in Davis.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.720
And I have pluot, you know, which is a plum.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.200
And my neighbor had a plum even before I planted my pluot.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.440
So, strange thing.

04:54.260 --> 05:05.260
Feralia februalis is a very attractive, mottled, kind of reticulate pattern, green and white

05:05.260 --> 05:09.700
noctua with black scale in a swill.

05:09.700 --> 05:16.320
And allegedly, there are two species going under this name.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.860
One is darker than the other.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.620
And there's some variability.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.620
And occasionally, you find specimens where the green is replaced by orange.

05:27.280 --> 05:34.480
And, in fact, if you put them in a relaxer with certain chemicals in it, the green will

05:34.480 --> 05:35.520
turn to orange.

05:35.520 --> 05:44.220
So, it could be an environmental thing or it could be food plant affects the color of

05:44.220 --> 05:47.140
the, what is normally green.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.380
But I've never seen orange ones from Cold Canyon.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.220
And I've never seen the moth in Davis.

05:54.220 --> 06:04.080
I don't know the food plant, but I think it's kind of a generalist on trees and shrubs.

06:05.080 --> 06:05.700
Talk to it.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.880
Phylatoma or phylaetema.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.160
Many species.

06:16.060 --> 06:18.100
There's not very good literature.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.560
It needs revision.

06:19.560 --> 06:24.800
You know, there was, this is similar looking to kyanotis.

06:24.900 --> 06:30.720
You can tell the males at the generic level very easily because they have some secondary

06:30.720 --> 06:36.580
scales on the hindwing, androconial scales on the hindwing.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.000
They call them curtain scales.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.700
So, if you look at them upside down.

06:40.980 --> 06:44.740
And then if you look at the tip of the abdomen, you can also see some characters.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.240
But the females are a little bit harder.

06:48.240 --> 06:56.520
And Wagner believes that shiny scales on the top of the abdomen are sufficient to tell them

06:56.520 --> 07:05.180
apart from the similar looking general, which would be kyanotis, aroga, and bryotropa, among

07:05.180 --> 07:05.660
others.

07:05.660 --> 07:12.320
There's, these are the ones that the wings are overlapping and flat on top of the body

07:12.320 --> 07:16.900
instead of tent-like or pitched roof-like.

07:16.900 --> 07:31.460
Fercula cynaroides was lumped with another species called cynaria for a while.

07:31.460 --> 07:34.380
And it was removed.

07:35.640 --> 07:41.140
It was, the status was changed in the recent monograph on not-a-dotted moth.

07:41.140 --> 07:51.760
And Wagner, who was co-author of the monograph, says that Miller, who was the first author, was

07:51.760 --> 07:52.300
a splitter.

07:53.040 --> 08:01.060
So, I don't know whether DNA studies were done on these, but this one, I think, feeds on

08:01.060 --> 08:01.580
willows.

08:01.580 --> 08:13.180
And, um, it looks almost identical to cynaria and a couple of other former subspecies that

08:13.180 --> 08:15.000
were elevated in the monograph.

08:15.700 --> 08:22.060
But it's, regardless of the name, it's all one species, probably native.

08:22.740 --> 08:28.780
And then, when it's included with all the things that used to be subspecies, it's transcontinental.

08:31.580 --> 08:37.420
And, um, Galleria melanella is the greater wax moth, and we discussed that previously.

08:38.620 --> 08:47.240
And I have stumbled across, um, honeybee hives or honeybee nests at Cull Canyon from time

08:47.240 --> 08:47.680
to time.

08:47.860 --> 08:53.620
So there are some, uh, wild honeybee populations.

08:53.620 --> 09:04.880
So they're not just coming out of, uh, apiary, uh, you know, agricultural honeybee colonies.

09:08.080 --> 09:15.120
Givira Marga is a, what's the family now?

09:15.120 --> 09:23.080
Look it up, and you can get the family.

09:24.280 --> 09:24.960
Cossidae.

09:25.160 --> 09:25.920
Yeah, cossids.

09:27.820 --> 09:31.780
Cossids are borers for the most part.

09:32.220 --> 09:39.300
And, um, sometimes get into infections, but often are primary borers.

09:39.300 --> 09:47.040
And I don't know too much about Givira Marga, but, you know, the prionnix is a big cossid.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.260
This is a small one.

09:49.860 --> 09:57.300
And the abdomen is disproportionately long when compared to the wingspan.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.580
So it's fairly easy.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.300
And then the antennae are very short.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.120
So it's a strange-looking moth and easy to recognize.

10:05.120 --> 10:14.440
And whether the specific name is correct or not is up for debate.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.060
It hasn't been resolved yet.

10:17.020 --> 10:26.220
But, um, this is what we, Greg and I, primarily have decided to call the local Givira.

10:26.220 --> 10:45.800
Hemeraplanis Historialis, um, it's a, now in the, um, what was split off from Noctuids?

10:46.380 --> 10:46.820
Aribid?

10:47.120 --> 10:47.560
Pardon me?

10:47.780 --> 10:48.260
Aribid?

10:48.560 --> 10:48.820
Yeah.

10:50.820 --> 10:55.140
I haven't talked moth in three weeks, and I'm losing it.

10:56.220 --> 11:02.040
Um, and, uh, it looks very much like a geometric and easily confusing.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.520
When I first collected these, you know, I showed them to Powell and showed them to other people.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.980
They couldn't come up with the name.

11:08.060 --> 11:11.540
And then finally when it came up, and then I couldn't remember the name.

11:11.540 --> 11:26.040
Um, but all of them are recorded, and, um, it used to be that I couldn't, we were calling them species Finitima, F-I-N-I-T-I-M-A, in the beginning.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.780
Um, so in the early spreadsheets, you may see that name.

11:31.120 --> 11:37.400
Um, but I couldn't tell it apart from this species, and then eventually they were all lumped under this name, so.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.420
It took care of that identity crisis.

11:41.420 --> 11:47.720
This is Henricus Ambrosana, we talked about in Davis.

11:48.020 --> 11:52.020
It's, uh, tortures from Oaks.

11:54.020 --> 12:05.560
In a, uh, subfamily, Coccolini, that's, uh, currently being revised, but one of the authors, uh, passed away.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.200
So, the revision may be less.

12:08.660 --> 12:22.980
By the way, that person who wrote the San Joaquin Valley Moth, uh, was the single fatality in a auto accident, not, in October or November.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.280
So, he's no longer with us.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.020
Oh, the thing that you reviewed?

12:27.420 --> 12:27.680
Yeah.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.500
Oh, no.

12:28.500 --> 12:38.040
He had been under care for some health conditions, so whether that contributed to the auto accident.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.620
Oh, that's awful.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.240
But, you know, it was kind of shocking.

12:42.480 --> 12:49.420
And, you know, I'm at the age where driving is scary, so when I hear things like that, it's, just rattles me.

12:49.900 --> 12:50.820
Plus, I liked him.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.160
He was a good friend.

12:53.400 --> 12:53.960
I'm sorry.

12:54.200 --> 12:54.640
That sucks.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.380
Hesperumia sulforaria.

12:57.380 --> 13:07.240
Um, this is a geometric yellow, but, um, varying amounts of black on the forewing.

13:07.720 --> 13:16.440
I've got it once in Davis, and I think it feeds on, um, adenostoma, but I'm not certain about that.

13:17.540 --> 13:23.680
And there is a second species, which can be confused with this.

13:23.680 --> 13:29.280
And for the longest time, I had no records of it, and then I got two of this similar species.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.540
And I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.

13:33.540 --> 13:50.580
But the similar species generally has, uh, considerably, well, a wide, somewhat wide, I should say, uh, black margin to the wings.

13:50.580 --> 14:04.500
And, uh, I thought that it wasn't, that other species was not here, but Mariah reported it from McLaughlin.

14:04.500 --> 14:12.740
And then when I looked at her specimens, I said, oh, and then not too long after that, I got a couple of specimens at Cold Canyon.

14:12.740 --> 14:24.560
But it's conceivable that some of the earlier records were misidentified, because previously I had called them all the other species, and then had a change of heart.

14:24.560 --> 14:43.400
So, um, there's another character, too, the dot, they call it the, there's a, um, spot in the disco cell of the four wings, and that, um, differs between the two species, but not 100% reliable.

14:43.400 --> 14:49.180
Homeosoma, homeosoma, electellus, and Davis, we talked about it.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.180
This is sometimes called the sunflower moth, or something.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.280
So, I think it feeds on seeds of a number of, uh, composites.

14:58.740 --> 15:07.040
And likely native, the ones in California look different than the ones in other parts of its, uh, its range.

15:07.040 --> 15:13.220
Uh, and as I mentioned before, the ones that are gray,

15:13.400 --> 15:34.860
rather than this kind of shiny, uh, tan color may be misidentified oslorellum, or, um, yet another species of, so there's some, but that's, it, nonetheless, it by far is the most common homeosoma in, uh, our area.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.120
Home orthodes communis, um,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.740
Um, I don't know much about it.

15:43.740 --> 15:50.240
Um, I think they're all identified correctly.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.800
Home ortho, these are noctuas, home orthodes hanami.

15:55.160 --> 16:03.120
The ones out here have a subspecies name, and they don't look like hanami from other parts of the range, but, um,

16:03.120 --> 16:09.960
they're easy, you know, once you recognize them, they're fairly easy to identify.

16:09.960 --> 16:10.300
All right.

16:10.500 --> 16:10.980
Thank you.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.580
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

16:26.580 --> 16:36.180
Mr.
