WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.360
Taking off now?

00:01.540 --> 00:03.500
No, I'm just going to use the bathroom, but you can keep going.

00:03.960 --> 00:04.100
Yeah.

00:04.220 --> 00:04.420
Okay.

00:05.040 --> 00:05.300
Okay.

00:07.740 --> 00:13.920
Epinodia postiliana, postiliana, sisquioansis.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.260
That's a mouthful.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.060
Yeah.

00:16.960 --> 00:25.200
The reason why I kept the subspecific name here is the, there was a, he's now a professor

00:25.200 --> 00:34.560
at Mississippi State who did, as his PhD project, a revision of North American species of Epinodia

00:34.560 --> 00:37.740
that, as far as I know, was never published.

00:38.740 --> 00:44.480
And he believed that sisquioansis was a distinct species from Pulsatana.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.920
So that's why I kept it here.

00:48.920 --> 00:56.400
And the basis for that is there's a wing fold that is longer in the coastal ones than,

00:56.960 --> 01:04.280
which are sisquioansis, than the other parts of the range.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.740
I've reared it.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.460
It feeds on, what is it?

01:09.460 --> 01:16.600
Arbutus, you know, Virgin's Valor is the common name.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.640
I don't know what Janus it said anymore.

01:19.820 --> 01:20.060
Pardon me.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.660
Wait, is it this?

01:23.120 --> 01:24.440
No, not Madrone.

01:24.740 --> 01:24.960
Oh.

01:26.940 --> 01:27.860
Virgin's Bower?

01:28.020 --> 01:29.020
Trillian Arbya.

01:30.980 --> 01:31.620
Clematis?

01:32.020 --> 01:32.500
What is it?

01:32.580 --> 01:32.760
Yeah.

01:34.080 --> 01:34.920
Clematis, yeah.

01:37.400 --> 01:44.620
Which is, you know, that's that vine that kind of gets up and goes over other trees and shrubs.

01:44.620 --> 01:53.420
So, I think it may be, because the food plant itself is supported by other shrubs,

01:53.820 --> 01:59.880
it may then, if the shrubs get burned out and the fire decline,

02:00.340 --> 02:06.620
it can be confused with those two species of decodes that we discussed earlier.

02:06.620 --> 02:12.500
These are all Ola through time tortrices, but the palpi are very different.

02:13.380 --> 02:21.060
But if you're not, if you don't examine the palpi, or if the palpi are broken off,

02:21.180 --> 02:23.720
you might confuse them for one another.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.800
Palpi often get broken in the killing vial.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.200
So, that's a problem.

02:33.540 --> 02:34.940
Epinodia signiferana.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.180
I think this is one that feeds on willow.

02:37.280 --> 02:37.960
I'm not sure.

02:37.960 --> 02:50.920
And this is one that has, it's kind of controversial as to whether it's a good species or not,

02:51.080 --> 03:00.960
but I'm using the name that Jerry gave me for ones that look like what he calls signiferana.

03:00.960 --> 03:07.960
Ethmia arctistaphylilla.

03:07.960 --> 03:20.300
Ethmias are sometimes put in their own family,

03:20.300 --> 03:26.800
but I think in the checklist, they're included with depressority.

03:28.980 --> 03:35.900
And Ethmia arctistaphylilla is one of these species that's misnamed

03:35.900 --> 03:38.300
because it doesn't feed on arctistaphylis.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.560
It feeds on eriodiction.

03:40.560 --> 03:51.480
And you can find adults flying during the day, well, during the night.

03:51.800 --> 03:57.180
The two species, the two common nocturnal species, which is this and the next one,

03:57.700 --> 04:01.980
are somewhat similar to one another.

04:01.980 --> 04:09.820
Plus, another species, which I have not recorded at Cold Canyon,

04:09.940 --> 04:15.920
but it has been collected at McLaughlin, so it's probably, it could be there,

04:16.060 --> 04:20.760
but I never saw one that I recorded as that other species,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.400
the name of which doesn't come to me.

04:26.040 --> 04:26.520
So,

04:26.520 --> 04:33.480
Disco strigella feeds on circocarpus.

04:34.740 --> 04:39.000
So it's widely distributed because circocarpus is quite widely distributed,

04:39.480 --> 04:43.520
whereas eriodiction is not so widely distributed,

04:44.280 --> 04:46.880
so arctistaphylilla has a narrower distribution.

04:46.880 --> 04:56.540
Arctistaphylilla has seasonal forms,

04:56.980 --> 05:01.520
and one form is very different from Disco strigella,

05:01.660 --> 05:03.900
where the other one is similar to Disco strigella,

05:04.100 --> 05:06.460
so they can be confused with one another,

05:06.700 --> 05:09.300
and they also can be confused with other species.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.980
But I think they're mostly recorded correctly,

05:11.980 --> 05:15.060
but because of the similarity,

05:15.400 --> 05:19.100
I can't say that every one was recorded correctly.

05:23.060 --> 05:27.160
Eublima minima is a very small noctuaid

05:27.160 --> 05:28.940
that feeds on

05:28.940 --> 05:33.760
Pearly Everlasting.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.920
Oh, I have no idea.

05:40.040 --> 05:40.980
I can't think of this.

05:43.140 --> 05:43.580
Anaphylus.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, Anaphylus.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.760
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, no,

05:46.800 --> 05:48.400
I want the phone book because it's solid paper.

05:48.860 --> 05:49.560
Yeah, and, you know,

05:49.620 --> 05:51.720
there's another plant that looks like Anaphylus.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.140
They're emergency plants.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.320
Naphthalion.

05:56.460 --> 05:57.260
With a G.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.580
And it may also feed on that,

06:00.640 --> 06:01.040
I don't know.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.180
Yeah, the plants are almost identical,

06:03.500 --> 06:04.080
and, you know,

06:04.140 --> 06:05.200
you have to pull them up

06:05.200 --> 06:07.640
and look at whether they have a tuberous root

06:07.640 --> 06:10.100
or not to tell them apart.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.200
I get this in Davis as well,

06:12.260 --> 06:13.160
but it's a small moth,

06:13.300 --> 06:16.640
and it has a peculiar lobe

06:16.640 --> 06:18.440
on the trailing edge of the wing,

06:18.940 --> 06:19.640
so it's...

06:19.640 --> 06:23.560
So the base of it is wider than,

06:24.440 --> 06:28.220
you know, makes an abrupt narrowing

06:28.220 --> 06:32.180
to the more apical portions of it,

06:32.420 --> 06:37.660
but it's easy to forget

06:37.660 --> 06:39.420
how to identify this,

06:40.140 --> 06:42.320
that hind wing sometimes

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
is the reminder to...

06:44.320 --> 06:47.080
It reminds me what it is.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.120
It looks like you've seen it more commonly

06:49.120 --> 06:50.380
in recent years.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.520
It could be,

06:51.520 --> 06:52.280
because, you know,

06:52.380 --> 06:53.760
Annapolis is a weedy plant

06:53.760 --> 06:56.680
and probably, you know,

06:56.720 --> 06:59.360
gets choked out by weedy grasses

06:59.360 --> 07:04.840
if there hasn't been a fire in a long time,

07:04.940 --> 07:09.120
and it may succeed quickly after fire,

07:09.260 --> 07:10.240
but, you know,

07:10.280 --> 07:11.620
I don't know enough about

07:11.620 --> 07:16.980
the post-fire ecology

07:16.980 --> 07:18.860
to make these, you know,

07:19.780 --> 07:22.340
if you're going to be focusing

07:22.340 --> 07:24.020
on what happens after fire,

07:24.260 --> 07:24.520
you know,

07:24.600 --> 07:26.200
there's probably somebody here

07:26.200 --> 07:27.340
on campus

07:27.340 --> 07:29.720
who has some good notions

07:29.720 --> 07:30.860
of what's going on.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.260
You know,

07:32.300 --> 07:33.860
we know that certain plants

07:33.860 --> 07:35.420
stump shoot after fire

07:35.420 --> 07:36.400
and another one's...

07:36.400 --> 07:37.800
Herodiction for a while,

07:37.860 --> 07:38.040
you know,

07:38.060 --> 07:39.520
was one of the first things

07:39.520 --> 07:40.980
that came back after the fire.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.140
This is a really good point

07:42.140 --> 07:44.600
that we should look and see.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.940
Let me talk to Andrew Latimer

07:46.940 --> 07:47.960
about that stuff.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.340
Euceracea castella

07:50.340 --> 07:53.980
is a...

07:54.520 --> 07:55.940
Sorry, the euclina,

07:56.220 --> 07:56.900
did you talk about?

07:57.680 --> 07:58.960
Euceracea castella.

07:59.020 --> 07:59.840
Oh, I'm out of order.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.240
Okay.

08:00.460 --> 08:00.580
Yeah.

08:00.980 --> 08:01.240
Okay.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.980
This is a plutelid.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.780
I'm not sure whether

08:07.780 --> 08:09.480
plutelid is recognized

08:09.480 --> 08:10.360
as a family.

08:10.360 --> 08:10.780
You know,

08:10.800 --> 08:11.600
some people treat it

08:11.600 --> 08:12.400
as a good family.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.900
Some people do not.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.080
Or,

08:16.320 --> 08:17.340
you know,

08:17.540 --> 08:18.500
Ipsilophidae.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.400
These are sometimes

08:20.400 --> 08:21.460
combined

08:21.460 --> 08:22.540
and sometimes not.

08:22.940 --> 08:23.360
So...

08:23.360 --> 08:27.360
Castella feeds on...

08:27.360 --> 08:33.700
plants and caperfoliaceae.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.320
It's iffy.

08:34.820 --> 08:35.220
Yeah, yeah.

08:35.300 --> 08:35.520
Okay.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.000
So...

08:37.000 --> 08:40.060
Like honeysuckles and things?

08:40.560 --> 08:40.860
Yeah.

08:40.860 --> 08:49.740
And I have collected it

08:49.740 --> 08:50.440
during the day,

08:50.520 --> 08:51.100
but I don't know

08:51.100 --> 08:51.700
if it's ones

08:51.700 --> 08:52.940
that I've just scared up

08:52.940 --> 08:55.060
or were actually flying

08:55.060 --> 08:55.760
during the day.

08:56.440 --> 08:56.860
It flies,

08:57.520 --> 08:58.640
I think,

08:58.700 --> 08:59.400
one generation

08:59.400 --> 09:00.020
per year

09:00.020 --> 09:01.240
and I'm...

09:01.240 --> 09:03.460
probably native.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.060
Almost certainly native.

09:06.060 --> 09:07.800
There's another species

09:07.800 --> 09:09.520
there that has

09:09.520 --> 09:10.500
the same wing shape

09:10.500 --> 09:15.020
and it's kind of

09:15.020 --> 09:15.780
tannish looking

09:15.780 --> 09:16.600
and then there's one

09:16.600 --> 09:17.300
that's intermediate

09:17.300 --> 09:18.360
and I don't know

09:18.360 --> 09:20.540
whether the intermediate

09:20.540 --> 09:21.440
looking one

09:21.440 --> 09:23.440
is at Cold Canyon

09:23.440 --> 09:23.980
or not,

09:24.100 --> 09:25.580
but if it is,

09:25.660 --> 09:26.480
I would have called it

09:26.480 --> 09:27.260
one or the other

09:27.260 --> 09:29.740
and didn't record it

09:29.740 --> 09:30.680
correctly.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.720
Euclina molisseria

09:33.720 --> 09:34.840
is a large

09:34.840 --> 09:38.160
geometria

09:38.160 --> 09:38.980
and I don't know

09:38.980 --> 09:39.900
very much about

09:39.900 --> 09:41.220
its biology,

09:41.500 --> 09:41.960
but it's easy

09:41.960 --> 09:42.600
to recognize,

09:42.920 --> 09:44.000
so I think

09:44.000 --> 09:44.860
every individual

09:44.860 --> 09:45.840
has been recorded

09:45.840 --> 09:46.600
correctly.

09:47.180 --> 09:47.880
Can we go back

09:47.880 --> 09:50.100
to the Euceraceae?

09:50.880 --> 09:51.480
Euceraceae?

09:51.980 --> 09:52.580
Euceraceae.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.320
What is the species

09:54.320 --> 09:55.540
that looks like it?

09:57.480 --> 09:58.760
I can't recall.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.040
Could you...

10:00.040 --> 10:00.500
Would it be

10:00.500 --> 10:01.180
in the dataset?

10:01.180 --> 10:01.200
Just type in

10:01.200 --> 10:02.060
euceraceae

10:02.060 --> 10:03.260
and see what pops up.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.240
Yeah.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.680
I do have records

10:10.680 --> 10:11.740
for the darker one

10:11.740 --> 10:13.240
that it didn't

10:13.240 --> 10:13.980
make the list.

10:14.320 --> 10:14.980
Yeah, exactly.

10:16.120 --> 10:19.240
But you're saying

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
basically that...

10:21.240 --> 10:22.120
Castella is...

10:22.120 --> 10:22.860
Is it possible

10:22.860 --> 10:23.660
they're a species

10:23.660 --> 10:24.240
complex?

10:25.640 --> 10:26.120
You said there's

10:26.120 --> 10:26.980
an intermediate block.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.000
No, I doubt

10:28.000 --> 10:29.240
that these are...

10:29.240 --> 10:30.860
that the three

10:30.860 --> 10:31.820
species that are

10:31.820 --> 10:32.900
recognized now

10:32.900 --> 10:34.840
are different forms

10:34.840 --> 10:35.900
of the same species,

10:36.080 --> 10:36.980
but I don't...

10:36.980 --> 10:38.400
But I don't know

10:38.400 --> 10:39.240
that for certain.

10:40.460 --> 10:40.980
Securella?

10:41.980 --> 10:43.180
Yeah, Securella

10:43.180 --> 10:44.260
is the other one,

10:44.340 --> 10:44.940
and then there's

10:44.940 --> 10:45.800
one that

10:45.800 --> 10:48.040
doesn't seem

10:48.040 --> 10:49.160
to be listed there.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.880
Oh, that's my list,

10:50.980 --> 10:51.120
though.

10:51.480 --> 10:51.700
Yeah.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.660
So those are

10:52.660 --> 10:53.400
the two species

10:53.400 --> 10:54.220
that I recorded.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.000
And then the one

10:55.000 --> 10:55.740
that's intermediate,

10:55.920 --> 10:56.620
I think it's called

10:56.620 --> 10:58.120
like Intermediella

10:58.120 --> 10:58.820
or something.

10:59.980 --> 11:00.840
It's a name

11:00.840 --> 11:01.660
that suggests

11:01.660 --> 11:02.500
that it's kind

11:02.500 --> 11:03.940
of in between.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.600
And I think

11:06.600 --> 11:07.320
Powell described

11:07.320 --> 11:08.120
that species,

11:08.280 --> 11:08.860
and the paper

11:08.860 --> 11:11.820
may provide

11:11.820 --> 11:12.640
some insight

11:12.640 --> 11:13.400
as to whether

11:13.400 --> 11:14.700
these are...

11:15.700 --> 11:16.440
whether there's

11:16.440 --> 11:17.300
strong evidence

11:17.300 --> 11:17.640
that they're

11:17.640 --> 11:18.340
separate species

11:18.340 --> 11:18.780
or not.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.480
But I think

11:21.480 --> 11:22.020
they feed on

11:22.020 --> 11:22.780
the same thing

11:22.780 --> 11:23.320
and they're

11:23.320 --> 11:24.240
all fly

11:24.240 --> 11:25.180
at the same time.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.640
But that's

11:28.640 --> 11:29.440
always a problem,

11:29.820 --> 11:30.720
especially if

11:30.720 --> 11:32.240
you're

11:32.240 --> 11:34.320
typological

11:34.320 --> 11:35.540
in what is

11:35.540 --> 11:36.040
and what is

11:36.040 --> 11:36.840
not a species

11:36.840 --> 11:37.640
rather than

11:37.640 --> 11:38.520
using other

11:38.520 --> 11:40.160
evidence.

11:41.060 --> 11:41.740
We're waiting

11:41.740 --> 11:42.420
for the DNA

11:42.420 --> 11:43.060
evidence.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.040
Well, I'm sure

11:45.040 --> 11:45.680
your collections

11:45.680 --> 11:46.240
will be used

11:46.240 --> 11:46.640
for that

11:46.640 --> 11:47.260
at some point.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.580
Eudonia.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.020
So, this

11:52.020 --> 11:52.480
would be the

11:52.480 --> 11:52.980
first one

11:52.980 --> 11:53.480
that I can...

11:53.480 --> 11:54.360
I had a notion

11:54.360 --> 11:54.820
for a while

11:54.820 --> 11:55.460
that Eudonia

11:55.460 --> 11:56.180
was one of

11:56.180 --> 11:56.660
the species

11:56.660 --> 11:57.240
that feeds

11:57.240 --> 11:57.880
on moss,

11:58.060 --> 11:59.120
but I think

11:59.120 --> 11:59.940
that's incorrect.

12:00.180 --> 12:00.640
And I think

12:00.640 --> 12:01.200
Eudonia

12:01.200 --> 12:02.740
rectilineida

12:02.740 --> 12:03.880
feeds on

12:03.880 --> 12:04.900
oaks.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.280
And it's

12:07.280 --> 12:08.280
the more

12:08.280 --> 12:09.440
common species

12:09.440 --> 12:11.400
at Cold Canyon

12:11.400 --> 12:13.940
and very

12:13.940 --> 12:14.700
distinct from

12:14.700 --> 12:15.640
the others.

12:17.160 --> 12:17.760
Spencer

12:17.760 --> 12:18.260
Rye

12:18.260 --> 12:19.000
is the

12:19.000 --> 12:19.600
most common

12:19.600 --> 12:20.060
one in

12:20.060 --> 12:20.480
Davis.

12:22.120 --> 12:22.440
And

12:22.440 --> 12:25.140
I don't know.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.020
I didn't look...

12:26.020 --> 12:26.260
You know,

12:26.320 --> 12:27.220
there is a

12:27.220 --> 12:27.720
monograph.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.020
One of the

12:29.020 --> 12:30.320
first Mona

12:30.320 --> 12:32.100
monographs

12:32.100 --> 12:33.620
covers this

12:33.620 --> 12:34.220
genus.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.680
and there

12:35.680 --> 12:36.340
may be some

12:36.340 --> 12:36.920
post-plant

12:36.920 --> 12:37.760
records in it,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.580
but if I did

12:40.580 --> 12:41.100
look it up,

12:41.160 --> 12:42.100
it's lost

12:42.100 --> 12:43.020
to antiquity.

12:43.020 --> 12:48.180
the other

12:48.180 --> 12:49.340
Eudonia

12:49.340 --> 12:49.780
there,

12:51.060 --> 12:51.740
I'm surprised

12:51.740 --> 12:52.180
it didn't

12:52.180 --> 12:52.900
make the list.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.120
Is it?

12:54.340 --> 12:54.520
Oh,

12:54.620 --> 12:54.860
Echo.

12:55.140 --> 12:55.400
Yeah.

12:56.200 --> 12:56.920
And that

12:56.920 --> 12:57.420
one's harder

12:57.420 --> 13:00.120
to identify.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.240
And I

13:01.240 --> 13:02.080
brought some

13:02.080 --> 13:02.820
home to

13:02.820 --> 13:03.420
dissect and

13:03.420 --> 13:03.840
never got

13:03.840 --> 13:04.520
around to it.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.460
And I'm

13:06.460 --> 13:06.880
not sure

13:06.880 --> 13:07.420
that every

13:07.420 --> 13:08.040
individual

13:08.040 --> 13:09.120
has been

13:09.120 --> 13:11.060
recorded.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.180
and

13:13.180 --> 13:15.340
those that

13:15.340 --> 13:15.660
I did

13:15.660 --> 13:16.060
record,

13:16.140 --> 13:16.480
I'm not

13:16.480 --> 13:17.540
sure if

13:17.540 --> 13:18.080
I didn't

13:18.080 --> 13:18.540
mistake

13:18.540 --> 13:19.000
them for

13:19.000 --> 13:19.440
other

13:19.440 --> 13:21.720
species

13:21.720 --> 13:23.920
of

13:23.920 --> 13:24.420
Eudonia,

13:24.580 --> 13:25.260
but even

13:25.260 --> 13:26.340
other species

13:26.340 --> 13:26.880
in different

13:26.880 --> 13:27.400
genera.

13:32.500 --> 13:32.820
So

13:32.820 --> 13:34.020
the ones

13:34.020 --> 13:34.340
that I

13:34.340 --> 13:35.000
comfortable

13:35.000 --> 13:35.740
in identifying

13:35.740 --> 13:36.040
as

13:36.040 --> 13:36.740
Rectilinia.

13:37.280 --> 13:37.960
Spenceri

13:37.960 --> 13:38.520
looks like

13:38.520 --> 13:38.820
another

13:38.820 --> 13:39.440
species,

13:39.780 --> 13:40.000
but

13:40.000 --> 13:44.320
Powell

13:44.320 --> 13:44.740
and I

13:44.740 --> 13:45.060
were in

13:45.060 --> 13:45.480
agreement

13:45.480 --> 13:45.960
that

13:45.960 --> 13:46.740
what I'm

13:46.740 --> 13:47.000
calling

13:47.000 --> 13:47.640
Spenceri

13:47.640 --> 13:47.780
are

13:47.780 --> 13:48.440
Spenceri

13:48.440 --> 13:48.900
and not

13:48.900 --> 13:49.480
the

13:49.480 --> 13:49.800
similar

13:49.800 --> 13:50.200
looking

13:50.200 --> 13:50.700
species.

13:52.160 --> 13:52.520
But we

13:52.520 --> 13:52.980
could both

13:52.980 --> 13:53.580
be wrong.

13:57.420 --> 13:57.800
You,

13:57.980 --> 13:58.900
Japanulatrix,

13:59.080 --> 14:00.380
like Japanulatrix,

14:00.600 --> 14:01.480
is a

14:01.480 --> 14:03.500
ceanothus

14:03.500 --> 14:03.840
feeder.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.940
it's

14:06.940 --> 14:07.620
kind of

14:07.620 --> 14:08.220
a

14:08.220 --> 14:09.140
pale

14:09.140 --> 14:10.160
moth,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.420
even

14:13.420 --> 14:14.900
towards

14:14.900 --> 14:15.480
whitish

14:15.480 --> 14:16.960
and

14:16.960 --> 14:19.220
throughout

14:19.220 --> 14:19.820
the year

14:19.820 --> 14:21.960
somewhat

14:21.960 --> 14:22.540
common.

14:22.540 --> 14:28.920
eupathesia

14:28.920 --> 14:29.880
nevidata.

14:30.120 --> 14:30.620
This

14:30.620 --> 14:31.600
is a

14:31.600 --> 14:32.140
conundrum

14:32.140 --> 14:32.860
because

14:32.860 --> 14:35.900
in the

14:35.900 --> 14:36.800
nevidata

14:36.800 --> 14:37.420
complex

14:37.420 --> 14:38.000
of

14:38.000 --> 14:38.420
species,

14:38.660 --> 14:39.200
nevidata

14:39.200 --> 14:39.860
and related

14:39.860 --> 14:40.760
species,

14:40.760 --> 14:42.780
there's

14:42.780 --> 14:43.080
one

14:43.080 --> 14:44.400
that

14:44.400 --> 14:44.800
is a

14:44.800 --> 14:45.560
possibility

14:45.560 --> 14:46.460
called

14:46.460 --> 14:49.900
implorata,

14:50.440 --> 14:51.120
which I've

14:51.120 --> 14:51.540
recorded.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.180
One

14:53.180 --> 14:53.880
called

14:53.880 --> 14:57.260
starts

14:57.260 --> 14:57.620
with a

14:57.620 --> 14:57.940
C,

14:58.980 --> 15:02.220
cestata,

15:02.740 --> 15:03.160
I think

15:03.160 --> 15:03.540
it is.

15:04.740 --> 15:05.640
And then

15:05.640 --> 15:05.900
one

15:05.900 --> 15:06.240
called

15:06.240 --> 15:08.080
well,

15:09.200 --> 15:09.680
the

15:09.680 --> 15:10.480
genitalia

15:10.480 --> 15:11.200
are similar

15:11.200 --> 15:11.720
to one

15:11.720 --> 15:12.120
another.

15:12.440 --> 15:12.700
And in

15:12.700 --> 15:13.080
some of

15:13.080 --> 15:13.300
those

15:13.300 --> 15:13.800
species,

15:14.220 --> 15:14.720
there's

15:14.720 --> 15:15.200
characters

15:15.200 --> 15:15.600
that

15:15.600 --> 15:16.200
differentiate

15:16.200 --> 15:16.660
the

15:16.660 --> 15:17.140
females,

15:17.340 --> 15:17.800
but not

15:17.800 --> 15:18.000
the

15:18.000 --> 15:18.440
males.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.680
And

15:20.680 --> 15:21.020
then

15:21.020 --> 15:21.720
it

15:21.720 --> 15:22.020
turned

15:22.020 --> 15:22.440
out

15:22.440 --> 15:27.820
let me

15:27.820 --> 15:28.280
backtrack

15:28.280 --> 15:28.520
a little.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.080
There have

15:29.080 --> 15:29.720
been three

15:29.720 --> 15:30.680
monographs

15:30.680 --> 15:31.040
on

15:31.040 --> 15:31.800
eupathesia.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.540
One was

15:33.540 --> 15:33.800
by

15:33.800 --> 15:34.500
McDonough

15:34.500 --> 15:34.940
and I

15:34.940 --> 15:35.360
think that

15:35.360 --> 15:37.420
was either

15:37.420 --> 15:37.720
in the

15:37.720 --> 15:38.520
late 30s

15:38.520 --> 15:38.800
or in

15:38.800 --> 15:39.500
the 40s.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.940
And it

15:41.940 --> 15:42.460
covered all

15:42.460 --> 15:43.100
the species

15:43.100 --> 15:45.180
with good

15:45.180 --> 15:46.180
illustrations of

15:46.180 --> 15:47.400
genitalia and

15:47.400 --> 15:48.440
some other

15:48.440 --> 15:49.700
characters.

15:50.740 --> 15:51.280
And then

15:51.280 --> 15:51.700
there was a

15:51.700 --> 15:52.100
guy named

15:52.100 --> 15:52.720
Bolte in

15:52.720 --> 15:53.420
Canada who

15:53.420 --> 15:54.620
covered only

15:54.620 --> 15:55.720
the Canadian

15:55.720 --> 15:56.260
species.

15:57.020 --> 15:57.540
And he not

15:57.540 --> 15:58.980
only looked at

15:58.980 --> 15:59.800
genitalia and

15:59.800 --> 16:00.200
everything, but

16:00.200 --> 16:00.460
he had

16:00.460 --> 16:01.760
illustrations of

16:01.760 --> 16:03.280
the head and

16:03.280 --> 16:03.940
antennal

16:03.940 --> 16:04.740
characters and

16:04.740 --> 16:05.220
things like

16:05.220 --> 16:06.020
that, which

16:06.020 --> 16:06.700
sometimes were

16:06.700 --> 16:07.300
diagnostic.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.340
So that in

16:09.340 --> 16:09.980
some ways was

16:09.980 --> 16:10.380
the best.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.200
And then most

16:11.200 --> 16:11.620
recently,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.640
Ferris, who

16:13.640 --> 16:15.720
is an

16:15.720 --> 16:16.320
engineer, I

16:16.320 --> 16:16.620
think he

16:16.620 --> 16:16.840
taught

16:16.840 --> 16:17.860
engineering in

16:17.860 --> 16:18.940
Wyoming, but

16:18.940 --> 16:19.260
was a

16:19.260 --> 16:20.140
butterfly collector

16:20.140 --> 16:20.840
for years.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.960
but he's

16:21.960 --> 16:22.760
an advanced

16:22.760 --> 16:23.940
collector, and

16:23.940 --> 16:25.720
he revisited the

16:25.720 --> 16:26.480
genus again.

16:27.280 --> 16:27.780
And the

16:27.780 --> 16:28.360
problem with

16:28.360 --> 16:29.880
the first one

16:29.880 --> 16:31.120
by McDonough is

16:31.120 --> 16:33.080
the photographs

16:33.080 --> 16:34.000
of the adults

16:34.000 --> 16:34.800
were printed on

16:34.800 --> 16:36.460
this horrible,

16:36.720 --> 16:37.520
poor quality,

16:37.740 --> 16:38.520
grainy paper,

16:38.780 --> 16:40.620
so they're not

16:40.620 --> 16:42.160
distinct looking.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.200
and they're

16:45.200 --> 16:45.620
black and

16:45.620 --> 16:46.220
white, and

16:46.220 --> 16:47.460
they're terrible

16:47.460 --> 16:48.020
quality.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.840
So Ferris, at

16:50.840 --> 16:52.020
the very least,

16:52.140 --> 16:53.220
provided better

16:53.220 --> 16:54.500
photographs, and

16:54.500 --> 16:55.320
he photographed the

16:55.320 --> 16:56.220
genitalia rather

16:56.220 --> 16:57.180
than drawings of

16:57.180 --> 16:58.960
them, which has

16:58.960 --> 16:59.660
pros and cons.

16:59.740 --> 17:00.360
One, it's more

17:00.360 --> 17:02.800
realistic, but you

17:02.800 --> 17:03.460
don't always

17:03.460 --> 17:05.120
emphasize the

17:05.120 --> 17:06.360
diagnostic characters.

17:06.360 --> 17:09.100
So, you

17:09.100 --> 17:09.720
know, when I

17:09.720 --> 17:10.460
have trouble, I

17:10.460 --> 17:11.140
kind of go to

17:11.140 --> 17:11.460
all of them.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.120
What turned

17:12.120 --> 17:12.740
out, when I

17:12.740 --> 17:13.240
looked at

17:13.240 --> 17:13.880
Ferris's

17:13.880 --> 17:15.080
photographs of

17:15.080 --> 17:15.700
what I have

17:15.700 --> 17:17.000
been calling

17:17.000 --> 17:20.860
Implorata, I

17:20.860 --> 17:22.900
obviously made

17:22.900 --> 17:24.120
them, I

17:24.120 --> 17:24.620
don't, I'm

17:24.620 --> 17:24.980
not in

17:24.980 --> 17:25.380
agreement.

17:25.900 --> 17:26.460
And what I

17:26.460 --> 17:27.380
called Implorata

17:27.380 --> 17:28.500
was based on

17:28.500 --> 17:29.080
the written

17:29.080 --> 17:30.560
description that

17:30.560 --> 17:31.380
McDonough made

17:31.380 --> 17:32.240
of Implorata.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.880
So now I'm

17:33.880 --> 17:36.600
thinking that it

17:36.600 --> 17:37.580
would be best to

17:37.580 --> 17:38.280
just call them

17:38.280 --> 17:40.160
to call

17:40.160 --> 17:41.340
Nevidata

17:41.340 --> 17:43.260
Implorata

17:43.260 --> 17:47.580
the questionable

17:47.580 --> 17:48.860
one, Sestata,

17:49.060 --> 17:49.900
and there's one

17:49.900 --> 17:50.400
that's like

17:50.400 --> 17:51.460
Sestatoides or

17:51.460 --> 17:52.080
something like

17:52.080 --> 17:52.260
that.

17:53.200 --> 17:53.780
Lump them all

17:53.780 --> 17:54.740
together and just

17:54.740 --> 17:56.520
call them Nevidata

17:56.520 --> 17:59.260
or, you know,

18:00.240 --> 18:01.720
or Nevidata or

18:01.720 --> 18:02.560
related species

18:02.560 --> 18:03.260
like I did

18:03.260 --> 18:03.500
here.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.000
But that's a

18:05.000 --> 18:05.760
bit, you know,

18:05.860 --> 18:06.520
Bolte couldn't

18:06.520 --> 18:07.220
figure it out

18:07.220 --> 18:07.820
when he did

18:07.820 --> 18:08.260
it and he

18:08.260 --> 18:08.760
was, I

18:08.760 --> 18:09.560
thought, the

18:09.560 --> 18:10.300
most careful

18:10.300 --> 18:11.380
of the bunch.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.400
So careful he

18:12.400 --> 18:14.120
went on to

18:14.120 --> 18:14.620
working on

18:14.620 --> 18:15.440
flies, which,

18:15.540 --> 18:15.840
you know,

18:16.060 --> 18:18.360
sends most

18:18.360 --> 18:18.960
people running

18:18.960 --> 18:19.680
for the exits.

18:21.280 --> 18:21.960
Okay, I'm

18:21.960 --> 18:22.360
going to stop

18:22.360 --> 18:22.800
this because
