280	1360	Taking off now?
1540	3500	No, I'm just going to use the bathroom, but you can keep going.
3960	4100	Yeah.
4220	4420	Okay.
5040	5300	Okay.
7740	13920	Epinodia postiliana, postiliana, sisquioansis.
14380	15260	That's a mouthful.
15840	16060	Yeah.
16960	25200	The reason why I kept the subspecific name here is the, there was a, he's now a professor
25200	34560	at Mississippi State who did, as his PhD project, a revision of North American species of Epinodia
34560	37740	that, as far as I know, was never published.
38740	44480	And he believed that sisquioansis was a distinct species from Pulsatana.
45700	48920	So that's why I kept it here.
48920	56400	And the basis for that is there's a wing fold that is longer in the coastal ones than,
56960	64280	which are sisquioansis, than the other parts of the range.
65000	65740	I've reared it.
65920	69460	It feeds on, what is it?
69460	76600	Arbutus, you know, Virgin's Valor is the common name.
76600	79640	I don't know what Janus it said anymore.
79820	80060	Pardon me.
80060	82660	Wait, is it this?
83120	84440	No, not Madrone.
84740	84960	Oh.
86940	87860	Virgin's Bower?
88020	89020	Trillian Arbya.
90980	91620	Clematis?
92020	92500	What is it?
92580	92760	Yeah.
94080	94920	Clematis, yeah.
97400	104620	Which is, you know, that's that vine that kind of gets up and goes over other trees and shrubs.
104620	113420	So, I think it may be, because the food plant itself is supported by other shrubs,
113820	119880	it may then, if the shrubs get burned out and the fire decline,
120340	126620	it can be confused with those two species of decodes that we discussed earlier.
126620	132500	These are all Ola through time tortrices, but the palpi are very different.
133380	141060	But if you're not, if you don't examine the palpi, or if the palpi are broken off,
141180	143720	you might confuse them for one another.
144120	147800	Palpi often get broken in the killing vial.
147800	151200	So, that's a problem.
153540	154940	Epinodia signiferana.
155200	157180	I think this is one that feeds on willow.
157280	157960	I'm not sure.
157960	170920	And this is one that has, it's kind of controversial as to whether it's a good species or not,
171080	180960	but I'm using the name that Jerry gave me for ones that look like what he calls signiferana.
180960	187960	Ethmia arctistaphylilla.
187960	200300	Ethmias are sometimes put in their own family,
200300	206800	but I think in the checklist, they're included with depressority.
208980	215900	And Ethmia arctistaphylilla is one of these species that's misnamed
215900	218300	because it doesn't feed on arctistaphylis.
219080	220560	It feeds on eriodiction.
220560	231480	And you can find adults flying during the day, well, during the night.
231800	237180	The two species, the two common nocturnal species, which is this and the next one,
237700	241980	are somewhat similar to one another.
241980	249820	Plus, another species, which I have not recorded at Cold Canyon,
249940	255920	but it has been collected at McLaughlin, so it's probably, it could be there,
256060	260760	but I never saw one that I recorded as that other species,
260920	263400	the name of which doesn't come to me.
266040	266520	So,
266520	273480	Disco strigella feeds on circocarpus.
274740	279000	So it's widely distributed because circocarpus is quite widely distributed,
279480	283520	whereas eriodiction is not so widely distributed,
284280	286880	so arctistaphylilla has a narrower distribution.
286880	296540	Arctistaphylilla has seasonal forms,
296980	301520	and one form is very different from Disco strigella,
301660	303900	where the other one is similar to Disco strigella,
304100	306460	so they can be confused with one another,
306700	309300	and they also can be confused with other species.
309720	311980	But I think they're mostly recorded correctly,
311980	315060	but because of the similarity,
315400	319100	I can't say that every one was recorded correctly.
323060	327160	Eublima minima is a very small noctuaid
327160	328940	that feeds on
328940	333760	Pearly Everlasting.
333760	336920	Oh, I have no idea.
340040	340980	I can't think of this.
343140	343580	Anaphylus.
343720	345000	Yeah, Anaphylus.
345300	346760	Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, no,
346800	348400	I want the phone book because it's solid paper.
348860	349560	Yeah, and, you know,
349620	351720	there's another plant that looks like Anaphylus.
352720	354140	They're emergency plants.
354840	355320	Naphthalion.
356460	357260	With a G.
357840	360580	And it may also feed on that,
360640	361040	I don't know.
361040	363180	Yeah, the plants are almost identical,
363500	364080	and, you know,
364140	365200	you have to pull them up
365200	367640	and look at whether they have a tuberous root
367640	370100	or not to tell them apart.
370540	372200	I get this in Davis as well,
372260	373160	but it's a small moth,
373300	376640	and it has a peculiar lobe
376640	378440	on the trailing edge of the wing,
378940	379640	so it's...
379640	383560	So the base of it is wider than,
384440	388220	you know, makes an abrupt narrowing
388220	392180	to the more apical portions of it,
392420	397660	but it's easy to forget
397660	399420	how to identify this,
400140	402320	that hind wing sometimes
402320	404320	is the reminder to...
404320	407080	It reminds me what it is.
407360	409120	It looks like you've seen it more commonly
409120	410380	in recent years.
410920	411520	It could be,
411520	412280	because, you know,
412380	413760	Annapolis is a weedy plant
413760	416680	and probably, you know,
416720	419360	gets choked out by weedy grasses
419360	424840	if there hasn't been a fire in a long time,
424940	429120	and it may succeed quickly after fire,
429260	430240	but, you know,
430280	431620	I don't know enough about
431620	436980	the post-fire ecology
436980	438860	to make these, you know,
439780	442340	if you're going to be focusing
442340	444020	on what happens after fire,
444260	444520	you know,
444600	446200	there's probably somebody here
446200	447340	on campus
447340	449720	who has some good notions
449720	450860	of what's going on.
451680	452260	You know,
452300	453860	we know that certain plants
453860	455420	stump shoot after fire
455420	456400	and another one's...
456400	457800	Herodiction for a while,
457860	458040	you know,
458060	459520	was one of the first things
459520	460980	that came back after the fire.
460980	462140	This is a really good point
462140	464600	that we should look and see.
465560	466940	Let me talk to Andrew Latimer
466940	467960	about that stuff.
468840	470340	Euceracea castella
470340	473980	is a...
474520	475940	Sorry, the euclina,
476220	476900	did you talk about?
477680	478960	Euceracea castella.
479020	479840	Oh, I'm out of order.
480000	480240	Okay.
480460	480580	Yeah.
480980	481240	Okay.
482520	483980	This is a plutelid.
486880	487780	I'm not sure whether
487780	489480	plutelid is recognized
489480	490360	as a family.
490360	490780	You know,
490800	491600	some people treat it
491600	492400	as a good family.
492560	494900	Some people do not.
495520	496080	Or,
496320	497340	you know,
497540	498500	Ipsilophidae.
499040	500400	These are sometimes
500400	501460	combined
501460	502540	and sometimes not.
502940	503360	So...
503360	507360	Castella feeds on...
507360	513700	plants and caperfoliaceae.
513700	514320	It's iffy.
514820	515220	Yeah, yeah.
515300	515520	Okay.
516520	517000	So...
517000	520060	Like honeysuckles and things?
520560	520860	Yeah.
520860	529740	And I have collected it
529740	530440	during the day,
530520	531100	but I don't know
531100	531700	if it's ones
531700	532940	that I've just scared up
532940	535060	or were actually flying
535060	535760	during the day.
536440	536860	It flies,
537520	538640	I think,
538700	539400	one generation
539400	540020	per year
540020	541240	and I'm...
541240	543460	probably native.
544720	546060	Almost certainly native.
546060	547800	There's another species
547800	549520	there that has
549520	550500	the same wing shape
550500	555020	and it's kind of
555020	555780	tannish looking
555780	556600	and then there's one
556600	557300	that's intermediate
557300	558360	and I don't know
558360	560540	whether the intermediate
560540	561440	looking one
561440	563440	is at Cold Canyon
563440	563980	or not,
564100	565580	but if it is,
565660	566480	I would have called it
566480	567260	one or the other
567260	569740	and didn't record it
569740	570680	correctly.
570680	573720	Euclina molisseria
573720	574840	is a large
574840	578160	geometria
578160	578980	and I don't know
578980	579900	very much about
579900	581220	its biology,
581500	581960	but it's easy
581960	582600	to recognize,
582920	584000	so I think
584000	584860	every individual
584860	585840	has been recorded
585840	586600	correctly.
587180	587880	Can we go back
587880	590100	to the Euceraceae?
590880	591480	Euceraceae?
591980	592580	Euceraceae.
592900	594320	What is the species
594320	595540	that looks like it?
597480	598760	I can't recall.
598960	600040	Could you...
600040	600500	Would it be
600500	601180	in the dataset?
601180	601200	Just type in
601200	602060	euceraceae
602060	603260	and see what pops up.
603960	604240	Yeah.
609400	610680	I do have records
610680	611740	for the darker one
611740	613240	that it didn't
613240	613980	make the list.
614320	614980	Yeah, exactly.
616120	619240	But you're saying
619240	621240	basically that...
621240	622120	Castella is...
622120	622860	Is it possible
622860	623660	they're a species
623660	624240	complex?
625640	626120	You said there's
626120	626980	an intermediate block.
626980	628000	No, I doubt
628000	629240	that these are...
629240	630860	that the three
630860	631820	species that are
631820	632900	recognized now
632900	634840	are different forms
634840	635900	of the same species,
636080	636980	but I don't...
636980	638400	But I don't know
638400	639240	that for certain.
640460	640980	Securella?
641980	643180	Yeah, Securella
643180	644260	is the other one,
644340	644940	and then there's
644940	645800	one that
645800	648040	doesn't seem
648040	649160	to be listed there.
649920	650880	Oh, that's my list,
650980	651120	though.
651480	651700	Yeah.
651700	652660	So those are
652660	653400	the two species
653400	654220	that I recorded.
654400	655000	And then the one
655000	655740	that's intermediate,
655920	656620	I think it's called
656620	658120	like Intermediella
658120	658820	or something.
659980	660840	It's a name
660840	661660	that suggests
661660	662500	that it's kind
662500	663940	of in between.
665540	666600	And I think
666600	667320	Powell described
667320	668120	that species,
668280	668860	and the paper
668860	671820	may provide
671820	672640	some insight
672640	673400	as to whether
673400	674700	these are...
675700	676440	whether there's
676440	677300	strong evidence
677300	677640	that they're
677640	678340	separate species
678340	678780	or not.
678780	681480	But I think
681480	682020	they feed on
682020	682780	the same thing
682780	683320	and they're
683320	684240	all fly
684240	685180	at the same time.
687480	688640	But that's
688640	689440	always a problem,
689820	690720	especially if
690720	692240	you're
692240	694320	typological
694320	695540	in what is
695540	696040	and what is
696040	696840	not a species
696840	697640	rather than
697640	698520	using other
698520	700160	evidence.
701060	701740	We're waiting
701740	702420	for the DNA
702420	703060	evidence.
704160	705040	Well, I'm sure
705040	705680	your collections
705680	706240	will be used
706240	706640	for that
706640	707260	at some point.
708780	710580	Eudonia.
711080	712020	So, this
712020	712480	would be the
712480	712980	first one
712980	713480	that I can...
713480	714360	I had a notion
714360	714820	for a while
714820	715460	that Eudonia
715460	716180	was one of
716180	716660	the species
716660	717240	that feeds
717240	717880	on moss,
718060	719120	but I think
719120	719940	that's incorrect.
720180	720640	And I think
720640	721200	Eudonia
721200	722740	rectilineida
722740	723880	feeds on
723880	724900	oaks.
725900	727280	And it's
727280	728280	the more
728280	729440	common species
729440	731400	at Cold Canyon
731400	733940	and very
733940	734700	distinct from
734700	735640	the others.
737160	737760	Spencer
737760	738260	Rye
738260	739000	is the
739000	739600	most common
739600	740060	one in
740060	740480	Davis.
742120	742440	And
742440	745140	I don't know.
745200	746020	I didn't look...
746020	746260	You know,
746320	747220	there is a
747220	747720	monograph.
748200	749020	One of the
749020	750320	first Mona
750320	752100	monographs
752100	753620	covers this
753620	754220	genus.
754220	755680	and there
755680	756340	may be some
756340	756920	post-plant
756920	757760	records in it,
757840	760580	but if I did
760580	761100	look it up,
761160	762100	it's lost
762100	763020	to antiquity.
763020	768180	the other
768180	769340	Eudonia
769340	769780	there,
771060	771740	I'm surprised
771740	772180	it didn't
772180	772900	make the list.
773760	774120	Is it?
774340	774520	Oh,
774620	774860	Echo.
775140	775400	Yeah.
776200	776920	And that
776920	777420	one's harder
777420	780120	to identify.
780680	781240	And I
781240	782080	brought some
782080	782820	home to
782820	783420	dissect and
783420	783840	never got
783840	784520	around to it.
785360	786460	And I'm
786460	786880	not sure
786880	787420	that every
787420	788040	individual
788040	789120	has been
789120	791060	recorded.
791060	793180	and
793180	795340	those that
795340	795660	I did
795660	796060	record,
796140	796480	I'm not
796480	797540	sure if
797540	798080	I didn't
798080	798540	mistake
798540	799000	them for
799000	799440	other
799440	801720	species
801720	803920	of
803920	804420	Eudonia,
804580	805260	but even
805260	806340	other species
806340	806880	in different
806880	807400	genera.
812500	812820	So
812820	814020	the ones
814020	814340	that I
814340	815000	comfortable
815000	815740	in identifying
815740	816040	as
816040	816740	Rectilinia.
817280	817960	Spenceri
817960	818520	looks like
818520	818820	another
818820	819440	species,
819780	820000	but
820000	824320	Powell
824320	824740	and I
824740	825060	were in
825060	825480	agreement
825480	825960	that
825960	826740	what I'm
826740	827000	calling
827000	827640	Spenceri
827640	827780	are
827780	828440	Spenceri
828440	828900	and not
828900	829480	the
829480	829800	similar
829800	830200	looking
830200	830700	species.
832160	832520	But we
832520	832980	could both
832980	833580	be wrong.
837420	837800	You,
837980	838900	Japanulatrix,
839080	840380	like Japanulatrix,
840600	841480	is a
841480	843500	ceanothus
843500	843840	feeder.
843840	846940	it's
846940	847620	kind of
847620	848220	a
848220	849140	pale
849140	850160	moth,
850520	853420	even
853420	854900	towards
854900	855480	whitish
855480	856960	and
856960	859220	throughout
859220	859820	the year
859820	861960	somewhat
861960	862540	common.
862540	868920	eupathesia
868920	869880	nevidata.
870120	870620	This
870620	871600	is a
871600	872140	conundrum
872140	872860	because
872860	875900	in the
875900	876800	nevidata
876800	877420	complex
877420	878000	of
878000	878420	species,
878660	879200	nevidata
879200	879860	and related
879860	880760	species,
880760	882780	there's
882780	883080	one
883080	884400	that
884400	884800	is a
884800	885560	possibility
885560	886460	called
886460	889900	implorata,
890440	891120	which I've
891120	891540	recorded.
892800	893180	One
893180	893880	called
893880	897260	starts
897260	897620	with a
897620	897940	C,
898980	902220	cestata,
902740	903160	I think
903160	903540	it is.
904740	905640	And then
905640	905900	one
905900	906240	called
906240	908080	well,
909200	909680	the
909680	910480	genitalia
910480	911200	are similar
911200	911720	to one
911720	912120	another.
912440	912700	And in
912700	913080	some of
913080	913300	those
913300	913800	species,
914220	914720	there's
914720	915200	characters
915200	915600	that
915600	916200	differentiate
916200	916660	the
916660	917140	females,
917340	917800	but not
917800	918000	the
918000	918440	males.
920000	920680	And
920680	921020	then
921020	921720	it
921720	922020	turned
922020	922440	out
922440	927820	let me
927820	928280	backtrack
928280	928520	a little.
928640	929080	There have
929080	929720	been three
929720	930680	monographs
930680	931040	on
931040	931800	eupathesia.
932640	933540	One was
933540	933800	by
933800	934500	McDonough
934500	934940	and I
934940	935360	think that
935360	937420	was either
937420	937720	in the
937720	938520	late 30s
938520	938800	or in
938800	939500	the 40s.
939920	941940	And it
941940	942460	covered all
942460	943100	the species
943100	945180	with good
945180	946180	illustrations of
946180	947400	genitalia and
947400	948440	some other
948440	949700	characters.
950740	951280	And then
951280	951700	there was a
951700	952100	guy named
952100	952720	Bolte in
952720	953420	Canada who
953420	954620	covered only
954620	955720	the Canadian
955720	956260	species.
957020	957540	And he not
957540	958980	only looked at
958980	959800	genitalia and
959800	960200	everything, but
960200	960460	he had
960460	961760	illustrations of
961760	963280	the head and
963280	963940	antennal
963940	964740	characters and
964740	965220	things like
965220	966020	that, which
966020	966700	sometimes were
966700	967300	diagnostic.
968300	969340	So that in
969340	969980	some ways was
969980	970380	the best.
970700	971200	And then most
971200	971620	recently,
971840	973640	Ferris, who
973640	975720	is an
975720	976320	engineer, I
976320	976620	think he
976620	976840	taught
976840	977860	engineering in
977860	978940	Wyoming, but
978940	979260	was a
979260	980140	butterfly collector
980140	980840	for years.
980840	981960	but he's
981960	982760	an advanced
982760	983940	collector, and
983940	985720	he revisited the
985720	986480	genus again.
987280	987780	And the
987780	988360	problem with
988360	989880	the first one
989880	991120	by McDonough is
991120	993080	the photographs
993080	994000	of the adults
994000	994800	were printed on
994800	996460	this horrible,
996720	997520	poor quality,
997740	998520	grainy paper,
998780	1000620	so they're not
1000620	1002160	distinct looking.
1002160	1005200	and they're
1005200	1005620	black and
1005620	1006220	white, and
1006220	1007460	they're terrible
1007460	1008020	quality.
1008680	1010840	So Ferris, at
1010840	1012020	the very least,
1012140	1013220	provided better
1013220	1014500	photographs, and
1014500	1015320	he photographed the
1015320	1016220	genitalia rather
1016220	1017180	than drawings of
1017180	1018960	them, which has
1018960	1019660	pros and cons.
1019740	1020360	One, it's more
1020360	1022800	realistic, but you
1022800	1023460	don't always
1023460	1025120	emphasize the
1025120	1026360	diagnostic characters.
1026360	1029100	So, you
1029100	1029720	know, when I
1029720	1030460	have trouble, I
1030460	1031140	kind of go to
1031140	1031460	all of them.
1031620	1032120	What turned
1032120	1032740	out, when I
1032740	1033240	looked at
1033240	1033880	Ferris's
1033880	1035080	photographs of
1035080	1035700	what I have
1035700	1037000	been calling
1037000	1040860	Implorata, I
1040860	1042900	obviously made
1042900	1044120	them, I
1044120	1044620	don't, I'm
1044620	1044980	not in
1044980	1045380	agreement.
1045900	1046460	And what I
1046460	1047380	called Implorata
1047380	1048500	was based on
1048500	1049080	the written
1049080	1050560	description that
1050560	1051380	McDonough made
1051380	1052240	of Implorata.
1052240	1053880	So now I'm
1053880	1056600	thinking that it
1056600	1057580	would be best to
1057580	1058280	just call them
1058280	1060160	to call
1060160	1061340	Nevidata
1061340	1063260	Implorata
1063260	1067580	the questionable
1067580	1068860	one, Sestata,
1069060	1069900	and there's one
1069900	1070400	that's like
1070400	1071460	Sestatoides or
1071460	1072080	something like
1072080	1072260	that.
1073200	1073780	Lump them all
1073780	1074740	together and just
1074740	1076520	call them Nevidata
1076520	1079260	or, you know,
1080240	1081720	or Nevidata or
1081720	1082560	related species
1082560	1083260	like I did
1083260	1083500	here.
1084560	1085000	But that's a
1085000	1085760	bit, you know,
1085860	1086520	Bolte couldn't
1086520	1087220	figure it out
1087220	1087820	when he did
1087820	1088260	it and he
1088260	1088760	was, I
1088760	1089560	thought, the
1089560	1090300	most careful
1090300	1091380	of the bunch.
1091600	1092400	So careful he
1092400	1094120	went on to
1094120	1094620	working on
1094620	1095440	flies, which,
1095540	1095840	you know,
1096060	1098360	sends most
1098360	1098960	people running
1098960	1099680	for the exits.
1101280	1101960	Okay, I'm
1101960	1102360	going to stop
1102360	1102800	this because
