1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,360
Taking off now?

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,500
No, I'm just going to use the bathroom, but you can keep going.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,100
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,420
Okay.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,300
Okay.

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,920
Epinodia postiliana, postiliana, sisquioansis.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,260
That's a mouthful.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,060
Yeah.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,200
The reason why I kept the subspecific name here is the, there was a, he's now a professor

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,560
at Mississippi State who did, as his PhD project, a revision of North American species of Epinodia

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,740
that, as far as I know, was never published.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,480
And he believed that sisquioansis was a distinct species from Pulsatana.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,920
So that's why I kept it here.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,400
And the basis for that is there's a wing fold that is longer in the coastal ones than,

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,280
which are sisquioansis, than the other parts of the range.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,740
I've reared it.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,460
It feeds on, what is it?

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:16,600
Arbutus, you know, Virgin's Valor is the common name.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,640
I don't know what Janus it said anymore.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,060
Pardon me.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,660
Wait, is it this?

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,440
No, not Madrone.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:24,960
Oh.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
Virgin's Bower?

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
Trillian Arbya.

26
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,620
Clematis?

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,500
What is it?

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:32,760
Yeah.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,920
Clematis, yeah.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,620
Which is, you know, that's that vine that kind of gets up and goes over other trees and shrubs.

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:53,420
So, I think it may be, because the food plant itself is supported by other shrubs,

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,880
it may then, if the shrubs get burned out and the fire decline,

33
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,620
it can be confused with those two species of decodes that we discussed earlier.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,500
These are all Ola through time tortrices, but the palpi are very different.

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,060
But if you're not, if you don't examine the palpi, or if the palpi are broken off,

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,720
you might confuse them for one another.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Palpi often get broken in the killing vial.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,200
So, that's a problem.

39
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,940
Epinodia signiferana.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,180
I think this is one that feeds on willow.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm not sure.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:50,920
And this is one that has, it's kind of controversial as to whether it's a good species or not,

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:00,960
but I'm using the name that Jerry gave me for ones that look like what he calls signiferana.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Ethmia arctistaphylilla.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:20,300
Ethmias are sometimes put in their own family,

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,800
but I think in the checklist, they're included with depressority.

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,900
And Ethmia arctistaphylilla is one of these species that's misnamed

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,300
because it doesn't feed on arctistaphylis.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
It feeds on eriodiction.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:51,480
And you can find adults flying during the day, well, during the night.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,180
The two species, the two common nocturnal species, which is this and the next one,

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,980
are somewhat similar to one another.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,820
Plus, another species, which I have not recorded at Cold Canyon,

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,920
but it has been collected at McLaughlin, so it's probably, it could be there,

55
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,760
but I never saw one that I recorded as that other species,

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,400
the name of which doesn't come to me.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,520
So,

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,480
Disco strigella feeds on circocarpus.

59
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,000
So it's widely distributed because circocarpus is quite widely distributed,

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,520
whereas eriodiction is not so widely distributed,

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,880
so arctistaphylilla has a narrower distribution.

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:56,540
Arctistaphylilla has seasonal forms,

63
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,520
and one form is very different from Disco strigella,

64
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,900
where the other one is similar to Disco strigella,

65
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,460
so they can be confused with one another,

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,300
and they also can be confused with other species.

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,980
But I think they're mostly recorded correctly,

68
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,060
but because of the similarity,

69
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,100
I can't say that every one was recorded correctly.

70
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,160
Eublima minima is a very small noctuaid

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,940
that feeds on

72
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,760
Pearly Everlasting.

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, I have no idea.

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,980
I can't think of this.

75
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,580
Anaphylus.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, Anaphylus.

77
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,760
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, no,

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
I want the phone book because it's solid paper.

79
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah, and, you know,

80
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,720
there's another plant that looks like Anaphylus.

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,140
They're emergency plants.

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,320
Naphthalion.

83
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,260
With a G.

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,580
And it may also feed on that,

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,040
I don't know.

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,180
Yeah, the plants are almost identical,

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,080
and, you know,

88
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,200
you have to pull them up

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,640
and look at whether they have a tuberous root

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,100
or not to tell them apart.

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,200
I get this in Davis as well,

92
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,160
but it's a small moth,

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,640
and it has a peculiar lobe

94
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,440
on the trailing edge of the wing,

95
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,640
so it's...

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,560
So the base of it is wider than,

97
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,220
you know, makes an abrupt narrowing

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,180
to the more apical portions of it,

99
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,660
but it's easy to forget

100
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,420
how to identify this,

101
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,320
that hind wing sometimes

102
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
is the reminder to...

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,080
It reminds me what it is.

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
It looks like you've seen it more commonly

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,380
in recent years.

106
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
It could be,

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,280
because, you know,

108
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,760
Annapolis is a weedy plant

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,680
and probably, you know,

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
gets choked out by weedy grasses

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,840
if there hasn't been a fire in a long time,

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,120
and it may succeed quickly after fire,

113
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,240
but, you know,

114
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,620
I don't know enough about

115
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,980
the post-fire ecology

116
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,860
to make these, you know,

117
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,340
if you're going to be focusing

118
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,020
on what happens after fire,

119
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,520
you know,

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
there's probably somebody here

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,340
on campus

122
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,720
who has some good notions

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,860
of what's going on.

124
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,260
You know,

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,860
we know that certain plants

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,420
stump shoot after fire

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,400
and another one's...

128
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Herodiction for a while,

129
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,040
you know,

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,520
was one of the first things

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,980
that came back after the fire.

132
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,140
This is a really good point

133
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,600
that we should look and see.

134
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,940
Let me talk to Andrew Latimer

135
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,960
about that stuff.

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,340
Euceracea castella

137
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,980
is a...

138
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,940
Sorry, the euclina,

139
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,900
did you talk about?

140
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Euceracea castella.

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh, I'm out of order.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay.

143
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:00,580
Yeah.

144
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,240
Okay.

145
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,980
This is a plutelid.

146
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,780
I'm not sure whether

147
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,480
plutelid is recognized

148
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,360
as a family.

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,780
You know,

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
some people treat it

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
as a good family.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,900
Some people do not.

153
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,080
Or,

154
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,340
you know,

155
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,500
Ipsilophidae.

156
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,400
These are sometimes

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,460
combined

158
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,540
and sometimes not.

159
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,360
So...

160
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Castella feeds on...

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,700
plants and caperfoliaceae.

162
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,320
It's iffy.

163
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,220
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,520
Okay.

165
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,000
So...

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,060
Like honeysuckles and things?

167
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,860
Yeah.

168
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:49,740
And I have collected it

169
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,440
during the day,

170
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,100
but I don't know

171
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,700
if it's ones

172
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,940
that I've just scared up

173
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,060
or were actually flying

174
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,760
during the day.

175
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,860
It flies,

176
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
I think,

177
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,400
one generation

178
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,020
per year

179
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,240
and I'm...

180
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,460
probably native.

181
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,060
Almost certainly native.

182
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,800
There's another species

183
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,520
there that has

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,500
the same wing shape

185
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,020
and it's kind of

186
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,780
tannish looking

187
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,600
and then there's one

188
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,300
that's intermediate

189
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,360
and I don't know

190
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,540
whether the intermediate

191
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,440
looking one

192
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
is at Cold Canyon

193
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,980
or not,

194
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
but if it is,

195
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,480
I would have called it

196
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,260
one or the other

197
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,740
and didn't record it

198
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,680
correctly.

199
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,720
Euclina molisseria

200
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
is a large

201
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,160
geometria

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,980
and I don't know

203
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,900
very much about

204
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,220
its biology,

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,960
but it's easy

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,600
to recognize,

207
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
so I think

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,860
every individual

209
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,840
has been recorded

210
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,600
correctly.

211
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,880
Can we go back

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,100
to the Euceraceae?

213
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,480
Euceraceae?

214
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Euceraceae.

215
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,320
What is the species

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,540
that looks like it?

217
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,760
I can't recall.

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Could you...

219
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,500
Would it be

220
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,180
in the dataset?

221
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,200
Just type in

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,060
euceraceae

223
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,260
and see what pops up.

224
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,240
Yeah.

225
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,680
I do have records

226
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,740
for the darker one

227
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,240
that it didn't

228
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,980
make the list.

229
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,980
Yeah, exactly.

230
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,240
But you're saying

231
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
basically that...

232
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
Castella is...

233
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,860
Is it possible

234
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,660
they're a species

235
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,240
complex?

236
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,120
You said there's

237
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,980
an intermediate block.

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,000
No, I doubt

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
that these are...

240
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,860
that the three

241
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,820
species that are

242
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,900
recognized now

243
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,840
are different forms

244
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,900
of the same species,

245
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,980
but I don't...

246
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,400
But I don't know

247
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
that for certain.

248
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,980
Securella?

249
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,180
Yeah, Securella

250
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,260
is the other one,

251
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,940
and then there's

252
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,800
one that

253
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,040
doesn't seem

254
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,160
to be listed there.

255
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
Oh, that's my list,

256
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,120
though.

257
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,700
Yeah.

258
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,660
So those are

259
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,400
the two species

260
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,220
that I recorded.

261
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,000
And then the one

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,740
that's intermediate,

263
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,620
I think it's called

264
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,120
like Intermediella

265
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,820
or something.

266
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,840
It's a name

267
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,660
that suggests

268
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
that it's kind

269
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,940
of in between.

270
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,600
And I think

271
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,320
Powell described

272
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
that species,

273
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,860
and the paper

274
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,820
may provide

275
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,640
some insight

276
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
as to whether

277
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,700
these are...

278
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,440
whether there's

279
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,300
strong evidence

280
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,640
that they're

281
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,340
separate species

282
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,780
or not.

283
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,480
But I think

284
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,020
they feed on

285
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,780
the same thing

286
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,320
and they're

287
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,240
all fly

288
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,180
at the same time.

289
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,640
But that's

290
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
always a problem,

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,720
especially if

292
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
you're

293
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
typological

294
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,540
in what is

295
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,040
and what is

296
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
not a species

297
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,640
rather than

298
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,520
using other

299
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,160
evidence.

300
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,740
We're waiting

301
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,420
for the DNA

302
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,060
evidence.

303
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,040
Well, I'm sure

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,680
your collections

305
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,240
will be used

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,640
for that

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,260
at some point.

308
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,580
Eudonia.

309
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,020
So, this

310
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,480
would be the

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,980
first one

312
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,480
that I can...

313
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,360
I had a notion

314
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,820
for a while

315
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,460
that Eudonia

316
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,180
was one of

317
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,660
the species

318
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,240
that feeds

319
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,880
on moss,

320
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,120
but I think

321
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,940
that's incorrect.

322
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,640
And I think

323
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,200
Eudonia

324
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,740
rectilineida

325
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,880
feeds on

326
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,900
oaks.

327
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,280
And it's

328
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
the more

329
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,440
common species

330
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,400
at Cold Canyon

331
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,940
and very

332
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,700
distinct from

333
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,640
the others.

334
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,760
Spencer

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,260
Rye

336
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,000
is the

337
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,600
most common

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,060
one in

339
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,480
Davis.

340
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,440
And

341
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,140
I don't know.

342
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,020
I didn't look...

343
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,260
You know,

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,220
there is a

345
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,720
monograph.

346
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,020
One of the

347
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,320
first Mona

348
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,100
monographs

349
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,620
covers this

350
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,220
genus.

351
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,680
and there

352
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,340
may be some

353
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,920
post-plant

354
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,760
records in it,

355
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,580
but if I did

356
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,100
look it up,

357
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,100
it's lost

358
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,020
to antiquity.

359
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,180
the other

360
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,340
Eudonia

361
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,780
there,

362
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm surprised

363
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,180
it didn't

364
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,900
make the list.

365
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,120
Is it?

366
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,520
Oh,

367
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,860
Echo.

368
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,400
Yeah.

369
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,920
And that

370
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,420
one's harder

371
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,120
to identify.

372
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,240
And I

373
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
brought some

374
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,820
home to

375
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,420
dissect and

376
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,840
never got

377
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,520
around to it.

378
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,460
And I'm

379
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:06,880
not sure

380
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,420
that every

381
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,040
individual

382
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
has been

383
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,060
recorded.

384
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,180
and

385
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,340
those that

386
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,660
I did

387
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,060
record,

388
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm not

389
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,540
sure if

390
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,080
I didn't

391
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,540
mistake

392
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,000
them for

393
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,440
other

394
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,720
species

395
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,920
of

396
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,420
Eudonia,

397
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,260
but even

398
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,340
other species

399
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,880
in different

400
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,400
genera.

401
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,820
So

402
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,020
the ones

403
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,340
that I

404
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,000
comfortable

405
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,740
in identifying

406
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,040
as

407
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,740
Rectilinia.

408
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,960
Spenceri

409
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,520
looks like

410
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,820
another

411
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,440
species,

412
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,000
but

413
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
Powell

414
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,740
and I

415
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,060
were in

416
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,480
agreement

417
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,960
that

418
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,740
what I'm

419
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,000
calling

420
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,640
Spenceri

421
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,780
are

422
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,440
Spenceri

423
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,900
and not

424
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,480
the

425
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,800
similar

426
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,200
looking

427
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,700
species.

428
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,520
But we

429
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:52,980
could both

430
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,580
be wrong.

431
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,800
You,

432
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,900
Japanulatrix,

433
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,380
like Japanulatrix,

434
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,480
is a

435
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,500
ceanothus

436
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,840
feeder.

437
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,940
it's

438
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,620
kind of

439
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,220
a

440
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,140
pale

441
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,160
moth,

442
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,420
even

443
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,900
towards

444
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,480
whitish

445
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
and

446
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,220
throughout

447
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,820
the year

448
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,960
somewhat

449
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,540
common.

450
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,920
eupathesia

451
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,880
nevidata.

452
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,620
This

453
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,600
is a

454
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,140
conundrum

455
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,860
because

456
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,900
in the

457
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,800
nevidata

458
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,420
complex

459
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,000
of

460
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,420
species,

461
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,200
nevidata

462
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,860
and related

463
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,760
species,

464
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,780
there's

465
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,080
one

466
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,400
that

467
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,800
is a

468
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,560
possibility

469
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,460
called

470
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,900
implorata,

471
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,120
which I've

472
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,540
recorded.

473
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,180
One

474
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,880
called

475
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,260
starts

476
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,620
with a

477
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:57,940
C,

478
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,220
cestata,

479
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,160
I think

480
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,540
it is.

481
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,640
And then

482
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:05,900
one

483
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,240
called

484
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,080
well,

485
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,680
the

486
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,480
genitalia

487
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,200
are similar

488
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,720
to one

489
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,120
another.

490
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,700
And in

491
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,080
some of

492
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,300
those

493
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,800
species,

494
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,720
there's

495
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,200
characters

496
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,600
that

497
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,200
differentiate

498
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,660
the

499
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,140
females,

500
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,800
but not

501
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,000
the

502
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,440
males.

503
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,680
And

504
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,020
then

505
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,720
it

506
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,020
turned

507
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,440
out

508
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,820
let me

509
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,280
backtrack

510
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,520
a little.

511
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,080
There have

512
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,720
been three

513
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
monographs

514
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,040
on

515
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,800
eupathesia.

516
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,540
One was

517
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:33,800
by

518
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,500
McDonough

519
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:34,940
and I

520
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,360
think that

521
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,420
was either

522
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,720
in the

523
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,520
late 30s

524
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,800
or in

525
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,500
the 40s.

526
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,940
And it

527
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,460
covered all

528
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,100
the species

529
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,180
with good

530
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
illustrations of

531
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,400
genitalia and

532
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,440
some other

533
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,700
characters.

534
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,280
And then

535
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,700
there was a

536
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,100
guy named

537
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,720
Bolte in

538
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,420
Canada who

539
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,620
covered only

540
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,720
the Canadian

541
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,260
species.

542
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,540
And he not

543
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,980
only looked at

544
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,800
genitalia and

545
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,200
everything, but

546
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,460
he had

547
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,760
illustrations of

548
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,280
the head and

549
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,940
antennal

550
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,740
characters and

551
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,220
things like

552
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,020
that, which

553
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,700
sometimes were

554
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,300
diagnostic.

555
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,340
So that in

556
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,980
some ways was

557
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,380
the best.

558
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,200
And then most

559
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,620
recently,

560
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,640
Ferris, who

561
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,720
is an

562
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,320
engineer, I

563
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,620
think he

564
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:16,840
taught

565
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,860
engineering in

566
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,940
Wyoming, but

567
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,260
was a

568
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,140
butterfly collector

569
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,840
for years.

570
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
but he's

571
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,760
an advanced

572
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,940
collector, and

573
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,720
he revisited the

574
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,480
genus again.

575
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,780
And the

576
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,360
problem with

577
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,880
the first one

578
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,120
by McDonough is

579
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
the photographs

580
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,000
of the adults

581
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
were printed on

582
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,460
this horrible,

583
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,520
poor quality,

584
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,520
grainy paper,

585
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,620
so they're not

586
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,160
distinct looking.

587
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,200
and they're

588
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,620
black and

589
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,220
white, and

590
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,460
they're terrible

591
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,020
quality.

592
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,840
So Ferris, at

593
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,020
the very least,

594
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,220
provided better

595
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,500
photographs, and

596
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,320
he photographed the

597
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,220
genitalia rather

598
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,180
than drawings of

599
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,960
them, which has

600
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,660
pros and cons.

601
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,360
One, it's more

602
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,800
realistic, but you

603
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,460
don't always

604
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,120
emphasize the

605
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,360
diagnostic characters.

606
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,100
So, you

607
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,720
know, when I

608
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,460
have trouble, I

609
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,140
kind of go to

610
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,460
all of them.

611
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,120
What turned

612
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,740
out, when I

613
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,240
looked at

614
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,880
Ferris's

615
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,080
photographs of

616
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,700
what I have

617
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,000
been calling

618
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,860
Implorata, I

619
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,900
obviously made

620
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,120
them, I

621
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,620
don't, I'm

622
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:24,980
not in

623
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,380
agreement.

624
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,460
And what I

625
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,380
called Implorata

626
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,500
was based on

627
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,080
the written

628
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,560
description that

629
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,380
McDonough made

630
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,240
of Implorata.

631
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,880
So now I'm

632
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,600
thinking that it

633
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,580
would be best to

634
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,280
just call them

635
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,160
to call

636
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,340
Nevidata

637
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,260
Implorata

638
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,580
the questionable

639
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,860
one, Sestata,

640
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,900
and there's one

641
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,400
that's like

642
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,460
Sestatoides or

643
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,080
something like

644
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,260
that.

645
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,780
Lump them all

646
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,740
together and just

647
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,520
call them Nevidata

648
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,260
or, you know,

649
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,720
or Nevidata or

650
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,560
related species

651
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,260
like I did

652
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,500
here.

653
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,000
But that's a

654
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
bit, you know,

655
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,520
Bolte couldn't

656
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,220
figure it out

657
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,820
when he did

658
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,260
it and he

659
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,760
was, I

660
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,560
thought, the

661
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,300
most careful

662
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,380
of the bunch.

663
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
So careful he

664
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,120
went on to

665
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,620
working on

666
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,440
flies, which,

667
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,840
you know,

668
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,360
sends most

669
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,960
people running

670
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
for the exits.

671
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,960
Okay, I'm

672
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,360
going to stop

673
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,800
this because
