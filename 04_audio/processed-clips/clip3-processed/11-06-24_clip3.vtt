00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
Annapena Triangulana, the only known host record was feeding on leaf litter underneath willow tree.

00:12.320 --> 00:17.300
And I had a willow in my yard that I had to have removed because it was damaging my roof.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.820
Ah, so that might be why it looks like it's declining.

00:21.820 --> 00:29.860
And I think I only got one or two this year, but the numbers, there was a brief period where it was pretty big numbers.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.240
And Art brought in some that he found, he said, swarming around ivy, which makes no sense.

00:37.400 --> 00:43.560
But unless they feed on leaf litter, because I don't think they're feeding on the live plants.

00:43.660 --> 00:47.060
But if they're feeding on litter, there's a lot of leaf litter under ivy.

00:48.060 --> 00:53.000
So do you know what year you had your willow tree removed? Do you remember?

00:53.420 --> 00:58.060
What year they had the big numbers? You could look in the...

00:58.060 --> 01:00.560
Well, what, when you had your willow tree removed?

01:02.160 --> 01:02.520
Uh...

01:02.520 --> 01:06.520
I don't remember, but it was...

01:06.520 --> 01:13.520
I could look it up. I could tell you that because I had the roof...

01:13.520 --> 01:16.240
Because I'm wondering if that's what happened here.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.220
Could be.

01:17.220 --> 01:33.960
Anstanoptelia marmorodacta is a terrafora that feeds on mints, various mints.

01:33.960 --> 01:50.580
So it has remained kind of consistently present in my yard, but the numbers may vary according to how many herbs are growing in the yard.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.580
In recent years, I grow...

01:52.580 --> 02:01.140
I have some rosemary that's permanent, but I grow basil every year, and that's about the only one.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.880
And whether the moth's feeding on it or not, I can't say.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.120
And what the neighbors are growing, I can't tell you.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.420
Did this...

02:08.420 --> 02:12.760
Do you think that this is real, that you didn't see it in the first, like, five years or so?

02:12.760 --> 02:16.460
I think it's probably real.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.440
Terraforas are not strongly attracted to light in general.

02:23.800 --> 02:31.760
At least that's kind of the anecdotal information I have on the...

02:32.680 --> 02:35.560
Aproima, this black one.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.860
Powell told me that this was another form of the one that I put a name on.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.660
The name of which...

02:46.660 --> 02:49.100
It's the name I'm using for the Cold Canyon one.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.620
But I think it's a different species.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.920
This is anapronina.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.280
A-P-R-O-A-E.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.120
So you think that...

03:08.120 --> 03:10.960
So this is anapronina nigrella nigrella?

03:10.960 --> 03:11.580
Yeah, yeah.

03:11.580 --> 03:15.400
Yeah, Jerry suggested that this is another form of nigrella.

03:15.660 --> 03:24.020
But there's one that looks like it, like this one, that goes under a different name on the Moth Photographers Group worksite.

03:24.360 --> 03:28.780
And it could be that they're both feed on the same food plant.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.040
And that he reared both from larvae collected on the same food plant.

03:33.040 --> 03:40.260
The food plant is what used to be called Lotus scoperia, but the name is not the same anymore.

03:40.440 --> 03:46.060
It's no longer in lotus and may not be scoperia anymore either, but, you know.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.460
So do you think that these are distinct species still?

03:48.460 --> 03:56.440
I don't think they're the same species anymore, because I only get the one farm in Davis, and I rarely get the black ones at Cold Canyon.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.220
Right, okay.

03:58.420 --> 04:06.540
I mean, it could be just a different genetics, but, you know, I don't know.

04:06.740 --> 04:11.860
It looks like they're declining here, and those species are declining in Cold Canyon, so...

04:11.860 --> 04:17.880
Well, at Cold Canyon, because it's lotus, and because that's one that probably burned up in the fire.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.480
That's some stuff we need to know.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.020
Yeah.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.020
I think fire is...

04:24.020 --> 04:31.020
Fire and weediness at Cold Canyon, although lotus scoperia is a weedy plant, so...

04:31.020 --> 04:44.220
Arkeps Argarapha is the fruit tree leaf roller, and it may be increasing because I replaced an exotic ash tree with a pluot tree.

04:44.740 --> 04:45.280
Hmm.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.380
But my neighbor always had a plum tree.

04:49.020 --> 04:53.540
Another neighbor had an apricot, which he removed, so...

04:53.540 --> 04:55.860
So, stones root's been around.

04:56.120 --> 04:56.260
It's always around.

04:56.260 --> 05:00.420
But Arkeps Argarapha, it's always associated with oaks.

05:00.740 --> 05:05.800
You find it in the wild near oaks, and it feeds on oak as well.

05:05.800 --> 05:15.000
So, it's polyphagous, but because it feeds on fruit trees, it's got its common name associated with fruit trees.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.660
But that could be why it's increased in my yard.

05:18.660 --> 05:28.000
And it tends to come to light a little bit later than, say, Klepsis and some of the other torcheses.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.680
So, I would think that if it were...

05:34.680 --> 05:43.000
I don't stay up as late as I did when I was younger, so I would think that if it was declining...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.320
That would be because of that?

05:45.320 --> 05:50.060
You know, we would attribute it to turning in earlier, but it's doing just the opposite.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.360
I've been getting more and more in recent years.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.900
So, I think this is real.

05:54.200 --> 05:54.520
Okay.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.620
But I don't have oaks in my yard, so it's kind of odd that I have it.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.060
Maybe they travel further.

06:01.340 --> 06:09.660
But it doesn't feed on low-growing plants as much as some of the other torcheses.

06:09.660 --> 06:19.600
So, Aristotelia fungiferella, I assume, feeds on some kind of fungus, but I don't know that for certain.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.400
I don't know much about this life history.

06:22.660 --> 06:27.720
I had this one called an Aristotelia species one, I think, for a while.

06:27.720 --> 06:34.120
But it's a dead set match for one on Moth Photographers Group.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.620
So, I think this name is probably correct, but I don't know about it.

06:38.820 --> 06:41.760
Aristotelia species two looks like some of the others.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.200
And I'll tell you which ones I think are all confused with one another.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.380
And I'm certain that this is probably two or more species.

06:49.380 --> 06:50.180
Species two.

06:50.180 --> 06:57.560
And there are quite a few Aristotelia, which I did not record anywhere.

07:01.980 --> 07:06.180
The ones that are distinct have been recorded consistently.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.960
And those are ones that I put a name on, for the most part.

07:13.420 --> 07:15.320
Species three looks like two.

07:15.460 --> 07:18.400
Species four looks a little bit like two.

07:20.180 --> 07:28.120
So, Aspila molesta is the oriental fruit model.

07:29.420 --> 07:33.600
An introduced species, a pest of fruit trees.

07:33.720 --> 07:40.680
It's a tiny tortoise, smaller, much smaller than most of the others.

07:42.040 --> 07:47.680
But it seemed to enjoy some good years and not so much recently.

07:47.680 --> 07:56.040
I think it and Prunivora is another small moth.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.220
This is a native one.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.720
Seem to be in decline.

08:02.860 --> 08:04.200
They've had a few good years.

08:04.200 --> 08:13.440
It's about the same time that the, what was the one we were talking about earlier?

08:13.440 --> 08:16.580
The one in leaf litter.

08:17.220 --> 08:17.540
Oh.

08:17.540 --> 08:17.600
Oh.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.040
Yeah.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.660
I can't remember things for 10 minutes.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.340
Me neither.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.700
Too much in the brain.

08:33.700 --> 08:44.100
I'm wondering, Grace, if you could make a note that maybe we could add a non-linear year predictor

08:44.100 --> 08:48.780
just to capture the species that are having parabolic responses.

08:50.020 --> 08:56.440
Yeah, I think it would be interesting to look at ones which coincidentally show similar patterns.

08:56.440 --> 09:01.140
And boom years and bust years.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.440
Because our model doesn't account for that, right?

09:03.060 --> 09:03.220
Yeah.

09:03.260 --> 09:16.440
Well, there is a possibility because certain parasitoids focus on species that have similar feeding niches.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.060
And they'll be like this.

09:19.260 --> 09:19.620
Yeah.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.120
Oscillate with the parasitoids.

09:21.140 --> 09:31.140
There may be a parasite that feeds on things that make a feeding shelter similar to that of those two species.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.420
I think the leaf litter moth was Annapena triangu.

09:36.420 --> 09:37.360
That's the one, yeah.

09:37.360 --> 09:47.780
Okay, we are at, okay, I talked about these last two at the same time pretty much.

09:48.820 --> 10:06.300
Autographia californica, this is, it's somewhat of a pest species and feeds on an array of plants.

10:06.300 --> 10:11.460
You get a lot of them early and a lot of them late and then sporadically in the middle of the year.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.560
And it seems to have very good years once in a while.

10:17.760 --> 10:22.160
I think the year before, last year was pretty good for it.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.920
Yep, it looks like it was.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.220
Oh, well, we don't have the data from last year, right?

10:28.180 --> 10:30.520
Bactra veritana feeds on sedges.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.480
So that's a weird host plant.

10:33.480 --> 10:43.400
And one year, I guess it was last year or maybe the year before, it really showed extreme numbers.

10:43.580 --> 10:45.300
And then it's down again this year.

10:45.960 --> 10:51.160
But it has shown up somewhat consistently all along.

10:51.160 --> 11:02.560
The gissara buxia seemed to be, my recollection was it was somewhat abundant in the early years

11:02.560 --> 11:05.580
and much less so in recent years.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.440
I haven't been getting it anywhere near the numbers that I used to get it.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.140
Okay, so true decline on that one, probably.

11:14.940 --> 11:19.240
Bedelia somnula telefeeds on plants in the Morning Glory family.

11:19.240 --> 11:28.460
And I've kind of given up trying to keep Morning Glory out of my yard, so that may account for.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.460
But also, it's common in the cold months.

11:34.460 --> 11:43.080
So, because I didn't collect in the cold months as often, partly because I didn't and partly because I couldn't,

11:43.140 --> 11:49.860
because there was more rain in the past, that could explain some of this recent abundance.

11:49.860 --> 12:04.140
Blastobasis glandulella, some of these may have been recorded as blastobasine species unidentified.

12:05.200 --> 12:11.320
These I separated out because they're bigger and considerably bigger than all the other blastobases.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.880
And there seems to be two forms.

12:13.880 --> 12:23.280
So, this could, might be two different species, but the pictures online show two different, the same two different phenotypes.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.180
Borchocenia nephrax.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.600
I only think I have a couple of records for this one.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.920
I'm surprised this is here.

12:35.460 --> 12:39.040
Oh, that's when I get more common earlier in the year, though.

12:39.040 --> 12:51.100
So, that may be why you saw a big spike last year, if that is last year or the year before last.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.760
Yeah, I think it goes up to 2023.

12:56.740 --> 13:02.120
Bucoletrics Albertiola feeds on live oaks, I think.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.260
And it may also feed on other oaks, but certainly live oaks.

13:05.260 --> 13:24.340
Bucoletrics is a tiny moth, and they tend to show up in big numbers during a, when the weather's kind of extreme, either real hot or kind of cold.

13:26.620 --> 13:32.660
It looks like he's been recording this.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.880
You're looking, I think you're looking at the other.

13:35.120 --> 13:35.900
I am, yeah.

13:36.040 --> 13:41.020
So, you've been recording this since at least the 90s.

13:41.640 --> 13:56.160
I called it, I called it species two at, I didn't give it the same number of Bucoletrics at Cold Canyon as I did at, this is Cold Canyon, as I did here.

13:56.160 --> 14:03.720
So, Bucoletrics Albertiola is a Bucoletrics species.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.140
It's a different species?

14:08.500 --> 14:08.600
Yeah.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.480
It's like a similar species?

14:09.520 --> 14:13.020
I think this one is Cianothiela, but I'm not sure.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.220
And you have it here, a species.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.080
Oh, so these should be binned?

14:19.080 --> 14:31.240
Yeah, and this is maybe Albertiola, because Bucoletrics species one at Cold Canyon is not the same as, you know, that was something I told you I would resolve, and I haven't done that yet.

14:31.240 --> 14:37.000
But I started on, and I get so far, and I thought, well, this is going to be quick, but it isn't.

14:37.080 --> 14:37.640
It's a lot of work.

14:37.740 --> 14:37.880
Yeah.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.800
So, that needs to be resolved.

14:43.080 --> 14:48.320
So, Bucoletrics is kind of a mess.

14:48.320 --> 15:01.020
But I'll tell you, I'll be able to tell you which is which, but for now, we'll assume that the names I'm using at Davis are correct.

15:02.380 --> 15:09.380
And there's only two, Albertiola and Cianothiela, but I don't think you have enough records to include it here.

15:09.380 --> 15:29.000
Cianothiela is another pantry moth, and I think in the early years, I probably failed to differentiate it from the Festiotes gilvacentella.

15:29.640 --> 15:34.560
So, it's probably underrepresented in the early years.

15:34.560 --> 15:47.620
It's a confoundingly variable species, and in the middle of the year, it's fairly uniform in phenotype.

15:48.040 --> 15:54.540
But late in the year, it's all over the place, different colors, different banding patterns, and everything else.

15:54.800 --> 16:00.480
I've set aside a bunch of them to dissect this year, and I'm hoping to get things straightened out.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.080
Well, we'll dump that one, too, because it's not an outdoor dwelling.

16:03.080 --> 16:09.760
And I'll keep sending you corrections and additions, which I hope will clarify things a bit.

16:10.080 --> 16:21.400
But I would say with, there's a very high probability that many of them were recorded as gilvacentella during the earliest years.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.180
And how many of the earliest years, I can't tell you.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.240
Gotcha.

16:26.840 --> 16:30.060
I think that's called a raisin moth or something like that.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.180
I need to...

16:32.180 --> 17:02.160
Thank you.
