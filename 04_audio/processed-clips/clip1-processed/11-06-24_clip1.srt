1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980
so if it's a matter of purging okay so this is john talking about the moths and the data that

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:17,720
grace has on them on the x-axis is year and on the y-axis is day positives which

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:26,820
is simply the number of times that john saw the moth and we have not adjusted on the y-axis for

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,540
the number of times john went out per year so he's going to talk about each moth and what we need

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:40,400
to know about the trends that we're seeing do you want to start with davis yes okay acaira rantalis

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,080
and acaira

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:52,020
occidentalis which you don't have here are two very similar species

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,460
and rantalis tends to be smaller and

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:07,360
has a more blurred pattern whereas occidentalis is larger you didn't plot occidentalis i see

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,340
occidentalis should it be here and we're missing it well we we do have it at davis i do have records

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,120
for it at davis but only one or two okay yeah i see so it may not be frequent

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,280
the genitalia are different and you can positively identify it by genitalia so i did a number of

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,480
um dissections and then since then i've been sorting them out primarily based on size and color but

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:44,180
there's a lot of them that still remain equivocal and those i continue to record as either or

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,160
so as a kyra species one of the two above

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,300
so early rec early ones if i didn't retain the specimen

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:07,840
may not have been recorded i may not have made an effort to identify it so i always recorded it as

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,580
uh one of the two above so maybe we should uh change this to a kyra spa

19
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,660
and well you could lump them all together for all three

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,300
bins so the rentalis occidentalis

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,600
i think a kyra occidentalis is one of them is known as the garden

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,980
something or other so it's a widespread moth the other one is strictly

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,920
western and i think that's occidentalis and rantalis is known to be

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:50,080
on alfalfa so i think the years that they grew alfalfa in the fields to the north of where i live

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,840
it probably was more common so in general the

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,860
number and frequency of them is probably correlated with whether they're

27
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,800
growing alfalfa or not and the small ones which is rantalis seem

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,540
to be far more common than the larger ones

29
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,420
and at cold canyon i think mostly i got larger ones

30
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25,800
because they don't grow any alfalfa in there but it probably feeds on other things because

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:35,740
um they're somewhat of a generalist okay

32
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,340
should we check the recording and make sure it's working is that what you're thinking

33
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,600
yeah is it still recording do we know are you okay yeah it's still working
