number of times that john saw the moth and we have not adjusted on the y-axis for the number of times john went out per year so he's going to talk about each moth and what we need to know about the trends that we're seeing do you want to start with davis yes okay acaira rantalis and acaira occidentalis which you don't have here are two very similar species and rantalis tends to be smaller and has a more blurred pattern whereas occidentalis is larger you didn't plot occidentalis i see occidentalis should it be here and we're missing it well we we do have it at davis i do have records for it at davis but only one or two okay yeah i see so it may not be frequent the genitalia are different and you can positively identify it by genitalia so i did a number of um dissections and then since then i've been sorting them out primarily based on size and color but there's a lot of them that still remain equivocal and those i continue to record as either or so as a kyra species one of the two above so early rec early ones if i didn't retain the specimen may not have been recorded i may not have made an effort to identify it so i always recorded it as uh one of the two above so maybe we should uh change this to a kyra spa and well you could lump them all together for all three bins so the rentalis occidentalis i think a kyra occidentalis is one of them is known as the garden something or other so it's a widespread moth the other one is strictly western and i think that's occidentalis and rantalis is known to be on alfalfa so i think the years that they grew alfalfa in the fields to the north of where i live it probably was more common so in general the number and frequency of them is probably correlated with whether they're growing alfalfa or not and the small ones which is rantalis seem to be far more common than the larger ones and at cold canyon i think mostly i got larger ones because they don't grow any alfalfa in there but it probably feeds on other things because um they're somewhat of a generalist okay should we check the recording and make sure it's working is that what you're thinking yeah is it still recording do we know are you okay yeah it's
