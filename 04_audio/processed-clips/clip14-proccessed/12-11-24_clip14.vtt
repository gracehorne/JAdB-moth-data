00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
Especially now when people are changing their landscaping and

00:03.240 --> 00:10.480
they're developing the lots near me and Davis Pond now goes dry when it used to have water in it

00:10.480 --> 00:17.380
the situation is changing considerably you know and I think it changes in different ways than

00:17.380 --> 00:28.320
the natural environment. So onward and upward. Oh we're out of time. Anna Vitranil I talked about.

00:28.320 --> 00:37.740
Anna Vitranil I talked about at Davis and at Davis I didn't get it for a lot of

00:37.740 --> 00:46.500
years and then it showed up and now it's shows up fairly commonly. I previously got it at

00:46.500 --> 00:57.840
the A is missing so or the generic name is missing here. It would be A-N-A if it were showing there.

00:58.320 --> 01:08.340
And you can see it. So this is a real trend. Yeah so this is this is real it didn't show up for a

01:08.340 --> 01:16.360
while but I caught it before that at Cold Canyon and the same thing happens it's been more common

01:16.360 --> 01:21.840
in recent years. I don't know why that is. I don't know enough about the host plants and

01:21.840 --> 01:31.860
they're two species which are similar and in Jerry the book the western moth books

01:31.860 --> 01:37.200
Oppler wrote if you can't tell them apart you need to dissect them. Well I can dissect them

01:37.200 --> 01:42.920
but I don't know which. I don't have illustrations so I don't. Do you know if one or both of these is

01:42.920 --> 01:48.900
native or non-native or you don't know? I don't know but they're probably native. Okay probably native

01:48.900 --> 01:55.840
but you don't know. And you know the other distinction I want to make and I'll say so at the

01:55.840 --> 02:04.620
time is there's non-native but there's also invasive non-native and invasive is somewhat

02:04.620 --> 02:10.860
important too. Well it's a it's a government classification so yeah. I mean this year one of

02:10.860 --> 02:19.340
the pantry moths exploded in my yard. I had no more than five prior to this year and I started getting

02:19.340 --> 02:31.180
them in 2020 and this year I got 43 of them minimum. So that's often the pattern with invasive species

02:31.180 --> 02:41.740
they show up. Ancelus columbia and another species it's not not out. This feeds on Ceanothus it's native

02:42.700 --> 02:51.020
and there's another species which is very similar. This has kind of falcate wing tips and the other one

02:51.020 --> 02:57.820
has more rounded but there's some that's kind of intermediate and I believe the genitalia are so

02:57.820 --> 03:07.740
similar that nobody's quite sure whether these are good species or not but it could be that this is

03:07.740 --> 03:15.420
one of those situations you know like encetina and newts or salamanders and some other things where

03:15.420 --> 03:20.700
they act like good species and part of their range but not in others so I don't know but

03:20.700 --> 03:28.700
Ancelus is a very distinct looking moth. They're all recorded as columbiana but they might be the

03:28.700 --> 03:36.220
other species the name of which doesn't pop into my head right now but I'll probably make that wake up

03:36.220 --> 03:45.340
in the middle of the night and yell it out. Anancia

03:49.100 --> 03:59.340
Anancia are small gray moths and Cosmopterygidae and they look very much like blastobases like the

03:59.340 --> 04:06.460
common blastobases and if you don't look carefully you're going to confuse them with one another.

04:09.900 --> 04:20.540
I believe all are native. Many of them feed on mints. I don't know what fasciata feeds on but this one

04:20.540 --> 04:30.540
is somewhat common. Orites I've reared from mints so I know that one and I think there may be one

04:30.540 --> 04:38.380
or two other species which show up less commonly but because they resemble blastobases if I didn't

04:38.380 --> 04:46.940
look carefully at the specimens I may have erroneously recorded them as that wastebasket category for

04:46.940 --> 04:55.100
blastobases. This year I got one that I've yet to dissect in my yard that may be an Anancia so

04:55.820 --> 05:00.140
that would be interesting because this could be another mint association.

05:00.700 --> 05:06.060
So their host plants are mint so I want to make sure we write down oh well you're getting the um

05:08.060 --> 05:14.700
you're getting the AI version too right okay um I want to make sure that we record host plant and

05:14.700 --> 05:22.540
native versus non-native. Do you think um fasciata also? I believe all Anancia are native. There's no

05:22.540 --> 05:29.260
reason to believe there's not but okay and you think this one feeds on mint even though I don't know the

05:29.260 --> 05:38.300
food plant of fasciata but there is a fascicle on Cosmopteridges and Hodges who wrote it probably

05:38.300 --> 05:46.460
if he had a food plant association he would have written it. The problem with Hodges is

05:48.460 --> 05:56.220
often on material from Berkeley Powell would record if he swept it off a plant he would record that

05:56.220 --> 06:02.460
the adult was on a certain plant but if the adult was there it's not necessarily the

06:02.460 --> 06:10.220
Harville food plant but Hodges uh interpreted that as meaning this is the food plant when

06:10.220 --> 06:15.740
sometimes it wasn't. Okay. But you know the literature is full of errors like that.

06:19.420 --> 06:27.500
Antep, Anteperoe semiotrata is a widespread moth probably it's a geometric

06:27.500 --> 06:34.780
widespread widespread probably native um I think I got it once in my yard but it's

06:34.780 --> 06:44.780
fairly common at Cold Canyon and reasonably easy to identify but some forms of some other geometries are

06:44.780 --> 06:45.260
similar.

06:45.260 --> 06:57.260
apanthesis ornata is a tiger moth uh so tiger moths used to be in their separate family now they're

06:57.260 --> 07:01.260
considered a sub-family of uh

07:02.860 --> 07:09.020
Aribidae, the one that split off from Noctuus on the basis

07:09.020 --> 07:18.780
of wing venation but you know Wagner who rears larvae thinks that a lot of these decisions

07:19.580 --> 07:25.420
if you look at the larvae are supported by larval morphology so tiger moths you know are the woolly

07:25.420 --> 07:32.780
bears and things like that so lots of secondary seeding. Generalists, tiger moths

07:32.780 --> 07:41.660
um many tiger moths seem to fly late at night so if I'm not staying up late at night I may miss them

07:42.940 --> 07:50.940
and um when I was at Briggs Hall you know sometimes in the morning the stairwells there act like a big

07:50.940 --> 07:58.220
flight trap and often you'd see salt marsh caterpillar or another tiger moth in big numbers

07:58.220 --> 08:06.620
um in the stairwell in the morning when you go to work but um you know I I seldom get them in my yard

08:06.620 --> 08:19.660
um tiger moths are subject to heavy parasitization my eye drops make my nose run and uh as well as the cold and

08:19.660 --> 08:29.660
you often see collapses in population so I think Rick Carman one time collected

08:30.300 --> 08:35.900
this big tiger moth that's out at Point Reyes and Bodega Marine Lab brought him back to the

08:35.900 --> 08:42.140
lab to rear and almost all of them were parasitized and I think I did the same thing when I was a kid

08:42.140 --> 08:56.140
uh from ones I got at Point Reyes Apro, Rima, Nigrella and Species One Jerry in the past told me that these were

08:58.220 --> 09:04.220
forms of the same species but I think that's erroneous because I only get the black ones in Davis

09:04.220 --> 09:15.980
Nigrella has black with two one or two bands across the forewing or stripes I should say they're narrow stripes

09:17.580 --> 09:27.020
and they're white or cream colored feeds on um what used to be lotus scoperius but it's been moved out of

09:27.020 --> 09:39.740
lotus I think you know which is the bushy lotus or what used to be lotus deer weed aporama nigrella

09:41.900 --> 09:43.420
and possibly the other one

09:43.420 --> 09:57.420
all right good no um I need water I'll be right back

10:04.620 --> 10:11.420
they're coming

10:13.420 --> 10:27.740
I can't find your hospital is a davis moth as well

10:28.860 --> 10:38.460
fruit tree leaf roller I believe and as I mentioned likely native um almost certainly native I would

10:38.460 --> 10:39.900
even though it's a pest species

10:42.860 --> 10:46.860
and it seems to be most common where there are so what's interesting at

10:49.420 --> 10:58.940
cold canyon is that immediately after fire you don't see it as commonly as

11:01.820 --> 11:06.540
normal years and that could be this depression here on your chart

11:09.260 --> 11:12.860
and another torturous which feeds on low-growing plants

11:13.420 --> 11:19.580
goes from being uncommon to being very common and then they gradually shift in

11:20.540 --> 11:23.420
so I'll talk about that when we get but I talked about our

11:23.420 --> 11:28.220
Kipsaga ross flow before and even though it's somewhat polyphagous

11:28.220 --> 11:33.660
it is most abundant in the vicinity of oaks

11:37.740 --> 11:47.340
Aristotelia argantiferous feeds on coyote bush and specific to it easy to identify unlike most of the

11:47.340 --> 11:54.220
Aristotelia so these are good records and coyote bush gets increasingly

11:54.940 --> 11:58.620
abundant you know it's not an early successor to fire but it

11:58.620 --> 12:03.820
seems to succeed fire much earlier than a lot of other plants do

12:03.820 --> 12:14.540
and all these Aristotelia two for two is probably at least two species the Aristotelian numbers at

12:16.700 --> 12:19.180
Cold Canyon are the same numbers I use for

12:19.820 --> 12:24.860
Davis so two and Davis is the same as two in cold canyon and so forth

12:26.460 --> 12:28.460
two is almost certainly two species

12:31.260 --> 12:35.020
the rest of them not so sure and as I mentioned one of them

12:35.980 --> 12:40.140
is probably not an Aristotelia and that was one of the ones at Davis

12:40.140 --> 12:45.260
when you can take a break so that we can start a new recording so the file doesn't get too big

12:45.260 --> 12:47.900
I'm okay
