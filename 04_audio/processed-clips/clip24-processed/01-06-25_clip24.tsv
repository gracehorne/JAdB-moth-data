0	15360	Meganola is in the family Nolidae, and this particular species I had under a different
15360	23780	name until recently, and Heinrich suggested that all the ones that he's collected around
23780	27640	here match miniscula better than the name that I was using.
27640	35400	And I was using the name that Bill Patterson was using, and I agree with Heinrich that
35400	42000	this name seems to be better, and I think we only have one species in this genus from
42000	42880	around here.
42880	45640	That's good.
45640	46640	Yeah, I know.
46640	48640	I've got a notification.
48640	50640	I have something from...
50640	64400	And this is another in that group of false underwing moths.
64400	65400	Yes, sir.
65400	66400	Thank you.
66400	73040	And easy to recognize, but could be...
73040	87100	It has a white hindwing, but it's not like Drasteria palisans, which is the false underwing
87100	91860	and Drasteria that's around here.
91860	96860	And this shows up in Davis sporadically.
96860	100860	Its abundance seems to vary a lot from year to year.
100860	102860	That's impressive.
102860	112620	Mesogona, Olaveta, and two other mesogona all feed on Madrone, not Madrone.
112620	117620	Well, maybe on Madrone, but certainly on Arctostaphyllus.
117620	130280	And where one species ends and the next one begin are a little bit tricky, but Olaveta seems
130280	137060	to be the most common species around here, but I do have the other two species from Cold
137060	144040	Canyon, and none of them in Davis yet, even though we're seeing more and more Arctostaphyllus
144040	152060	being planted as a drought-tolerant shrubbery.
152060	166320	My Marista subcostalis is a crammed, looks very tropical-looking, you know, has very pointed
166320	173740	wings and so forth, translucent portions of the wing.
173740	181100	Very easy to recognize, somewhat common at Cold Canyon.
181100	184760	I think I've got it once in my yard, but I'm not certain.
184760	190760	Go to the restroom, but you guys keep going.
190760	204760	Marifacarma ebernella is a Gellicaea that feeds on Bracken fern, which is unusual.
204760	215480	You know, ferns don't have too many things that feed on it because ferns have a chemical that's
215480	219760	somewhat of an analog to juvenile hormone of insects.
219760	235040	You find a lot of plants that have phytotoxic or toxic chemicals to many species have specialists
235040	241520	which have overcome the resistance, and it's interesting that there's a lot of species
241520	246960	will feed on ferns and only ferns and nothing else, or feed on oaks and nothing else, so
246960	252240	they've overcome the toxic qualities.
252240	255240	Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns?
255240	256240	Pardon me?
256240	259600	Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns, do you think?
259600	261600	It's only on Bracken ferns, yeah.
261600	271040	Monfa species one and Monfa species two are probably the same thing.
271040	284260	Based on Kyla, who was the world expert on Monfaids, I sent him the specimens and he did
284260	288720	not put a name on this, he just called it a new species.
288720	296560	And he seemed to group together ones that were under number one and number two.
296560	303680	And number one and number two, I only separated on the basis, the pattern was the same, but
305520	313040	one of them had bright white ground color with black markings, and the other one had kind of a
313040	323760	cream colored four wing, much less bright. But it could be that that is a sex difference,
323760	333760	or it could be that it's just a seasonal farmer. Monfids feed on a gray sea family for the most part.
333760	346480	And then Monfa species three turned out not to be a Monfa at all, and I don't know what they are, but I only had three specimens.
347440	352080	And I seem to have misplaced them, so. Oh no. I may have put them in the wrong...
354560	358720	Myelopsis alatella, I don't know much about it. It's a physitine
360800	365840	pyralis, so there may be more information in the monographs.
365840	372720	Monographs. The monographs, there's three or four of them in the Mona series, and then there was an
372720	378800	earlier monograph by Heinrich, which you can download
382240	390400	in the American Museum, Proceedings of the American Museum, or one of the American museums. It's a big book.
390400	391120	It's not.
398960	402160	This is an interesting species, because there appears to be...
403120	409280	It's known for certain that in Europe, there's both resident populations and migratory ones.
410400	418560	So, remember earlier we were talking about flight periods and how you assess it? Well, if you have
418560	422240	resident populations and migratory populations,
425680	433440	when the flight actually begins, it's complicated due to the migratory populations.
435680	442640	But in Europe, it's known that the migratory generation or populations show up
442640	449760	later in the year, towards the end of summer and fall. So, probably the same thing is going on here.
449760	458880	And you look at the early season specimens look a little bit different than the ones later in the
458880	465280	year, but I think there's only one species involved here, unless the migratory ones are a different
465280	472400	species than the non-migratory ones. And I don't know whether the DNA studies have been made. Somebody
472400	479760	gave a seminar on this here, when I was still employed, so more than 20 years ago. And
479760	485280	I, at that time, that person who was looking at them in Europe
487120	494000	had not done any DNA studies. But at that time, DNA studies were just beginning to catch fire.
496000	499760	Other species that have migratory and resident populations are
499760	505920	high leaves lineata, the white line sphinx. So, that's another one that's going to be confused if you try to
506880	514240	identify flight periods. Eric has a student who's working on flight periods of the South Carolina moths that he's
514240	516720	surveying. So, um,
518800	523360	and then painted ladies is another one. But there's probably more that we don't know about.
523360	526960	But most of them seem to be larger species. I don't think
526960	533280	any micros are known to migrate too far for those little guys to go, I think.
534400	541520	But they may disperse, um, because you find things which shouldn't be in Davis, in Davis.
541520	547920	You know, and I get them multiple times, and yet the food plant isn't here as far as I know.
549360	553120	So, they get around somehow. It could be wind-blown because they're so small.
553120	571040	I got into arguments with Wagner about this because
574560	578880	well, I don't want to go into it. But for the longest time, they said,
578880	584400	we only have Oregonensis here. And in fact, Miller, who was the first author of this Notodonid,
584400	590000	called me up and said, we only have Oregonensis here. And later on, they backtracked on that and said
590000	600000	you have both species. And so, I vacillated between calling it Gabosa and Oregonensis. And finally, I said,
600000	605840	okay, okay, they're and or. And the external character that they used
609280	616560	doesn't seem to be reliable. And I don't know whether the genitalia are different or not, but
616560	625040	I haven't looked into the monograph that well, that closely.
629760	635120	And I didn't save a lot of specimens because I thought they were all one.
635120	644480	But what happened is I sent a female to Wagner that laid eggs. And
644480	655600	he kind of messed up things in the monograph. So I was very upset about that because, you know,
655600	662080	he attributes this to me. And, you know, I told him over and over again, I don't know this. And
662080	669280	instead of resolving it, you know, he would argue with me based upon his animosity towards one of the
669280	675840	other co-authors on what it was or was not. And, you know, because he changed positions over time,
676480	679200	I think it's screwed up in the monograph.
682160	685920	So whether there's one or two species, I can't tell you for sure. I think they're
685920	690880	more likely all Oregonensis than a mixture of the two species.
690880	702400	Nema Pogan species one, I think this is the one we're calling near Arcella. But Arcella is no longer
702400	711280	a valid name. And that name, Arcella, and the identification, Nema Pogan near Arcella came from
711280	728640	Don Davis, who was the primitive moth specialist at the Smithsonian. And so he kind of claimed
728640	735920	most of the primitive families of moths as his territory and would only allow you to work on them
735920	746880	if they were impossible to work on. In any event, this seems to be the most common species of Nema Pogan,
746880	756080	both in Davis and in Cold Canyon. But the species are kind of similar to one another,
756080	759200	and whether they're all identified correctly or not, I don't know.
759200	769600	A difference that Powell told me was the color of the tuft of hair-like feathers on the crown of the head.
770800	775280	So they're white in one species and kind of a
778000	783200	dirty white, brownish white on this near Arcella thing.
783200	792880	So there's probably at least two and maybe
795520	802880	well more than two specimens. Tanaids are difficult, and I haven't resolved it.
804400	809120	Powell knew Tanaids pretty well because he did some papers on the ones that feed on
809120	830800	various fungi in California. And, you know, he had some notions, but I don't know.
