00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Meganola is in the family Nolidae, and this particular species I had under a different

00:15.360 --> 00:23.780
name until recently, and Heinrich suggested that all the ones that he's collected around

00:23.780 --> 00:27.640
here match miniscula better than the name that I was using.

00:27.640 --> 00:35.400
And I was using the name that Bill Patterson was using, and I agree with Heinrich that

00:35.400 --> 00:42.000
this name seems to be better, and I think we only have one species in this genus from

00:42.000 --> 00:42.880
around here.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.640
That's good.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
Yeah, I know.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.640
I've got a notification.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.640
I have something from...

00:50.640 --> 01:04.400
And this is another in that group of false underwing moths.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
Yes, sir.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
Thank you.

01:06.400 --> 01:13.040
And easy to recognize, but could be...

01:13.040 --> 01:27.100
It has a white hindwing, but it's not like Drasteria palisans, which is the false underwing

01:27.100 --> 01:31.860
and Drasteria that's around here.

01:31.860 --> 01:36.860
And this shows up in Davis sporadically.

01:36.860 --> 01:40.860
Its abundance seems to vary a lot from year to year.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.860
That's impressive.

01:42.860 --> 01:52.620
Mesogona, Olaveta, and two other mesogona all feed on Madrone, not Madrone.

01:52.620 --> 01:57.620
Well, maybe on Madrone, but certainly on Arctostaphyllus.

01:57.620 --> 02:10.280
And where one species ends and the next one begin are a little bit tricky, but Olaveta seems

02:10.280 --> 02:17.060
to be the most common species around here, but I do have the other two species from Cold

02:17.060 --> 02:24.040
Canyon, and none of them in Davis yet, even though we're seeing more and more Arctostaphyllus

02:24.040 --> 02:32.060
being planted as a drought-tolerant shrubbery.

02:32.060 --> 02:46.320
My Marista subcostalis is a crammed, looks very tropical-looking, you know, has very pointed

02:46.320 --> 02:53.740
wings and so forth, translucent portions of the wing.

02:53.740 --> 03:01.100
Very easy to recognize, somewhat common at Cold Canyon.

03:01.100 --> 03:04.760
I think I've got it once in my yard, but I'm not certain.

03:04.760 --> 03:10.760
Go to the restroom, but you guys keep going.

03:10.760 --> 03:24.760
Marifacarma ebernella is a Gellicaea that feeds on Bracken fern, which is unusual.

03:24.760 --> 03:35.480
You know, ferns don't have too many things that feed on it because ferns have a chemical that's

03:35.480 --> 03:39.760
somewhat of an analog to juvenile hormone of insects.

03:39.760 --> 03:55.040
You find a lot of plants that have phytotoxic or toxic chemicals to many species have specialists

03:55.040 --> 04:01.520
which have overcome the resistance, and it's interesting that there's a lot of species

04:01.520 --> 04:06.960
will feed on ferns and only ferns and nothing else, or feed on oaks and nothing else, so

04:06.960 --> 04:12.240
they've overcome the toxic qualities.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.240
Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns?

04:15.240 --> 04:16.240
Pardon me?

04:16.240 --> 04:19.600
Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns, do you think?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
It's only on Bracken ferns, yeah.

04:21.600 --> 04:31.040
Monfa species one and Monfa species two are probably the same thing.

04:31.040 --> 04:44.260
Based on Kyla, who was the world expert on Monfaids, I sent him the specimens and he did

04:44.260 --> 04:48.720
not put a name on this, he just called it a new species.

04:48.720 --> 04:56.560
And he seemed to group together ones that were under number one and number two.

04:56.560 --> 05:03.680
And number one and number two, I only separated on the basis, the pattern was the same, but

05:05.520 --> 05:13.040
one of them had bright white ground color with black markings, and the other one had kind of a

05:13.040 --> 05:23.760
cream colored four wing, much less bright. But it could be that that is a sex difference,

05:23.760 --> 05:33.760
or it could be that it's just a seasonal farmer. Monfids feed on a gray sea family for the most part.

05:33.760 --> 05:46.480
And then Monfa species three turned out not to be a Monfa at all, and I don't know what they are, but I only had three specimens.

05:47.440 --> 05:52.080
And I seem to have misplaced them, so. Oh no. I may have put them in the wrong...

05:54.560 --> 05:58.720
Myelopsis alatella, I don't know much about it. It's a physitine

06:00.800 --> 06:05.840
pyralis, so there may be more information in the monographs.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.720
Monographs. The monographs, there's three or four of them in the Mona series, and then there was an

06:12.720 --> 06:18.800
earlier monograph by Heinrich, which you can download

06:22.240 --> 06:30.400
in the American Museum, Proceedings of the American Museum, or one of the American museums. It's a big book.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.120
It's not.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.160
This is an interesting species, because there appears to be...

06:43.120 --> 06:49.280
It's known for certain that in Europe, there's both resident populations and migratory ones.

06:50.400 --> 06:58.560
So, remember earlier we were talking about flight periods and how you assess it? Well, if you have

06:58.560 --> 07:02.240
resident populations and migratory populations,

07:05.680 --> 07:13.440
when the flight actually begins, it's complicated due to the migratory populations.

07:15.680 --> 07:22.640
But in Europe, it's known that the migratory generation or populations show up

07:22.640 --> 07:29.760
later in the year, towards the end of summer and fall. So, probably the same thing is going on here.

07:29.760 --> 07:38.880
And you look at the early season specimens look a little bit different than the ones later in the

07:38.880 --> 07:45.280
year, but I think there's only one species involved here, unless the migratory ones are a different

07:45.280 --> 07:52.400
species than the non-migratory ones. And I don't know whether the DNA studies have been made. Somebody

07:52.400 --> 07:59.760
gave a seminar on this here, when I was still employed, so more than 20 years ago. And

07:59.760 --> 08:05.280
I, at that time, that person who was looking at them in Europe

08:07.120 --> 08:14.000
had not done any DNA studies. But at that time, DNA studies were just beginning to catch fire.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.760
Other species that have migratory and resident populations are

08:19.760 --> 08:25.920
high leaves lineata, the white line sphinx. So, that's another one that's going to be confused if you try to

08:26.880 --> 08:34.240
identify flight periods. Eric has a student who's working on flight periods of the South Carolina moths that he's

08:34.240 --> 08:36.720
surveying. So, um,

08:38.800 --> 08:43.360
and then painted ladies is another one. But there's probably more that we don't know about.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.960
But most of them seem to be larger species. I don't think

08:46.960 --> 08:53.280
any micros are known to migrate too far for those little guys to go, I think.

08:54.400 --> 09:01.520
But they may disperse, um, because you find things which shouldn't be in Davis, in Davis.

09:01.520 --> 09:07.920
You know, and I get them multiple times, and yet the food plant isn't here as far as I know.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.120
So, they get around somehow. It could be wind-blown because they're so small.

09:13.120 --> 09:31.040
I got into arguments with Wagner about this because

09:34.560 --> 09:38.880
well, I don't want to go into it. But for the longest time, they said,

09:38.880 --> 09:44.400
we only have Oregonensis here. And in fact, Miller, who was the first author of this Notodonid,

09:44.400 --> 09:50.000
called me up and said, we only have Oregonensis here. And later on, they backtracked on that and said

09:50.000 --> 10:00.000
you have both species. And so, I vacillated between calling it Gabosa and Oregonensis. And finally, I said,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.840
okay, okay, they're and or. And the external character that they used

10:09.280 --> 10:16.560
doesn't seem to be reliable. And I don't know whether the genitalia are different or not, but

10:16.560 --> 10:25.040
I haven't looked into the monograph that well, that closely.

10:29.760 --> 10:35.120
And I didn't save a lot of specimens because I thought they were all one.

10:35.120 --> 10:44.480
But what happened is I sent a female to Wagner that laid eggs. And

10:44.480 --> 10:55.600
he kind of messed up things in the monograph. So I was very upset about that because, you know,

10:55.600 --> 11:02.080
he attributes this to me. And, you know, I told him over and over again, I don't know this. And

11:02.080 --> 11:09.280
instead of resolving it, you know, he would argue with me based upon his animosity towards one of the

11:09.280 --> 11:15.840
other co-authors on what it was or was not. And, you know, because he changed positions over time,

11:16.480 --> 11:19.200
I think it's screwed up in the monograph.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.920
So whether there's one or two species, I can't tell you for sure. I think they're

11:25.920 --> 11:30.880
more likely all Oregonensis than a mixture of the two species.

11:30.880 --> 11:42.400
Nema Pogan species one, I think this is the one we're calling near Arcella. But Arcella is no longer

11:42.400 --> 11:51.280
a valid name. And that name, Arcella, and the identification, Nema Pogan near Arcella came from

11:51.280 --> 12:08.640
Don Davis, who was the primitive moth specialist at the Smithsonian. And so he kind of claimed

12:08.640 --> 12:15.920
most of the primitive families of moths as his territory and would only allow you to work on them

12:15.920 --> 12:26.880
if they were impossible to work on. In any event, this seems to be the most common species of Nema Pogan,

12:26.880 --> 12:36.080
both in Davis and in Cold Canyon. But the species are kind of similar to one another,

12:36.080 --> 12:39.200
and whether they're all identified correctly or not, I don't know.

12:39.200 --> 12:49.600
A difference that Powell told me was the color of the tuft of hair-like feathers on the crown of the head.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.280
So they're white in one species and kind of a

12:58.000 --> 13:03.200
dirty white, brownish white on this near Arcella thing.

13:03.200 --> 13:12.880
So there's probably at least two and maybe

13:15.520 --> 13:22.880
well more than two specimens. Tanaids are difficult, and I haven't resolved it.

13:24.400 --> 13:29.120
Powell knew Tanaids pretty well because he did some papers on the ones that feed on

13:29.120 --> 13:50.800
various fungi in California. And, you know, he had some notions, but I don't know.
