1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Meganola is in the family Nolidae, and this particular species I had under a different

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,780
name until recently, and Heinrich suggested that all the ones that he's collected around

3
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,640
here match miniscula better than the name that I was using.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,400
And I was using the name that Bill Patterson was using, and I agree with Heinrich that

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,000
this name seems to be better, and I think we only have one species in this genus from

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,880
around here.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,640
That's good.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Yeah, I know.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
I've got a notification.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
I have something from...

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:04,400
And this is another in that group of false underwing moths.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Thank you.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,040
And easy to recognize, but could be...

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:27,100
It has a white hindwing, but it's not like Drasteria palisans, which is the false underwing

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,860
and Drasteria that's around here.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,860
And this shows up in Davis sporadically.

18
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,860
Its abundance seems to vary a lot from year to year.

19
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860
That's impressive.

20
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:52,620
Mesogona, Olaveta, and two other mesogona all feed on Madrone, not Madrone.

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Well, maybe on Madrone, but certainly on Arctostaphyllus.

22
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:10,280
And where one species ends and the next one begin are a little bit tricky, but Olaveta seems

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,060
to be the most common species around here, but I do have the other two species from Cold

24
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:24,040
Canyon, and none of them in Davis yet, even though we're seeing more and more Arctostaphyllus

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:32,060
being planted as a drought-tolerant shrubbery.

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:46,320
My Marista subcostalis is a crammed, looks very tropical-looking, you know, has very pointed

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,740
wings and so forth, translucent portions of the wing.

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:01,100
Very easy to recognize, somewhat common at Cold Canyon.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,760
I think I've got it once in my yard, but I'm not certain.

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Go to the restroom, but you guys keep going.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Marifacarma ebernella is a Gellicaea that feeds on Bracken fern, which is unusual.

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:35,480
You know, ferns don't have too many things that feed on it because ferns have a chemical that's

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,760
somewhat of an analog to juvenile hormone of insects.

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:55,040
You find a lot of plants that have phytotoxic or toxic chemicals to many species have specialists

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,520
which have overcome the resistance, and it's interesting that there's a lot of species

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,960
will feed on ferns and only ferns and nothing else, or feed on oaks and nothing else, so

37
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,240
they've overcome the toxic qualities.

38
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns?

39
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Pardon me?

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Is this species a specialist on Bracken ferns, do you think?

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
It's only on Bracken ferns, yeah.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:31,040
Monfa species one and Monfa species two are probably the same thing.

43
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:44,260
Based on Kyla, who was the world expert on Monfaids, I sent him the specimens and he did

44
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,720
not put a name on this, he just called it a new species.

45
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,560
And he seemed to group together ones that were under number one and number two.

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,680
And number one and number two, I only separated on the basis, the pattern was the same, but

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,040
one of them had bright white ground color with black markings, and the other one had kind of a

48
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:23,760
cream colored four wing, much less bright. But it could be that that is a sex difference,

49
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:33,760
or it could be that it's just a seasonal farmer. Monfids feed on a gray sea family for the most part.

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:46,480
And then Monfa species three turned out not to be a Monfa at all, and I don't know what they are, but I only had three specimens.

51
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,080
And I seem to have misplaced them, so. Oh no. I may have put them in the wrong...

52
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Myelopsis alatella, I don't know much about it. It's a physitine

53
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,840
pyralis, so there may be more information in the monographs.

54
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Monographs. The monographs, there's three or four of them in the Mona series, and then there was an

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,800
earlier monograph by Heinrich, which you can download

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,400
in the American Museum, Proceedings of the American Museum, or one of the American museums. It's a big book.

57
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
It's not.

58
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
This is an interesting species, because there appears to be...

59
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,280
It's known for certain that in Europe, there's both resident populations and migratory ones.

60
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,560
So, remember earlier we were talking about flight periods and how you assess it? Well, if you have

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
resident populations and migratory populations,

62
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,440
when the flight actually begins, it's complicated due to the migratory populations.

63
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,640
But in Europe, it's known that the migratory generation or populations show up

64
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,760
later in the year, towards the end of summer and fall. So, probably the same thing is going on here.

65
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:38,880
And you look at the early season specimens look a little bit different than the ones later in the

66
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,280
year, but I think there's only one species involved here, unless the migratory ones are a different

67
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,400
species than the non-migratory ones. And I don't know whether the DNA studies have been made. Somebody

68
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,760
gave a seminar on this here, when I was still employed, so more than 20 years ago. And

69
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,280
I, at that time, that person who was looking at them in Europe

70
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,000
had not done any DNA studies. But at that time, DNA studies were just beginning to catch fire.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Other species that have migratory and resident populations are

72
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,920
high leaves lineata, the white line sphinx. So, that's another one that's going to be confused if you try to

73
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,240
identify flight periods. Eric has a student who's working on flight periods of the South Carolina moths that he's

74
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
surveying. So, um,

75
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
and then painted ladies is another one. But there's probably more that we don't know about.

76
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,960
But most of them seem to be larger species. I don't think

77
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,280
any micros are known to migrate too far for those little guys to go, I think.

78
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,520
But they may disperse, um, because you find things which shouldn't be in Davis, in Davis.

79
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,920
You know, and I get them multiple times, and yet the food plant isn't here as far as I know.

80
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
So, they get around somehow. It could be wind-blown because they're so small.

81
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:31,040
I got into arguments with Wagner about this because

82
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
well, I don't want to go into it. But for the longest time, they said,

83
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,400
we only have Oregonensis here. And in fact, Miller, who was the first author of this Notodonid,

84
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,000
called me up and said, we only have Oregonensis here. And later on, they backtracked on that and said

85
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you have both species. And so, I vacillated between calling it Gabosa and Oregonensis. And finally, I said,

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,840
okay, okay, they're and or. And the external character that they used

87
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,560
doesn't seem to be reliable. And I don't know whether the genitalia are different or not, but

88
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:25,040
I haven't looked into the monograph that well, that closely.

89
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,120
And I didn't save a lot of specimens because I thought they were all one.

90
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:44,480
But what happened is I sent a female to Wagner that laid eggs. And

91
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:55,600
he kind of messed up things in the monograph. So I was very upset about that because, you know,

92
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,080
he attributes this to me. And, you know, I told him over and over again, I don't know this. And

93
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,280
instead of resolving it, you know, he would argue with me based upon his animosity towards one of the

94
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,840
other co-authors on what it was or was not. And, you know, because he changed positions over time,

95
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
I think it's screwed up in the monograph.

96
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,920
So whether there's one or two species, I can't tell you for sure. I think they're

97
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,880
more likely all Oregonensis than a mixture of the two species.

98
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Nema Pogan species one, I think this is the one we're calling near Arcella. But Arcella is no longer

99
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:51,280
a valid name. And that name, Arcella, and the identification, Nema Pogan near Arcella came from

100
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:08,640
Don Davis, who was the primitive moth specialist at the Smithsonian. And so he kind of claimed

101
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,920
most of the primitive families of moths as his territory and would only allow you to work on them

102
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:26,880
if they were impossible to work on. In any event, this seems to be the most common species of Nema Pogan,

103
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:36,080
both in Davis and in Cold Canyon. But the species are kind of similar to one another,

104
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,200
and whether they're all identified correctly or not, I don't know.

105
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:49,600
A difference that Powell told me was the color of the tuft of hair-like feathers on the crown of the head.

106
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,280
So they're white in one species and kind of a

107
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,200
dirty white, brownish white on this near Arcella thing.

108
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:12,880
So there's probably at least two and maybe

109
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:22,880
well more than two specimens. Tanaids are difficult, and I haven't resolved it.

110
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,120
Powell knew Tanaids pretty well because he did some papers on the ones that feed on

111
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:50,800
various fungi in California. And, you know, he had some notions, but I don't know.
