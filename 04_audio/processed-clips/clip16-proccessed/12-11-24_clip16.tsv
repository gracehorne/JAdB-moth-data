960	11460	I always like separates, preferable to electronic, you know, because I never can find anything that I store as an electronic file.
11820	18620	Yeah, yeah, it's a, that amount of information, that organization of it is something that most of us struggle with.
18620	32740	I databased all of them before, but now when you buy the suite of office programs, they no longer provide the database.
32740	45380	So I'm in the process of trying to convert what databases I still have to Lotus, one, two, three, Excel files.
45680	47420	God, I'm stuck in the past.
48620	51100	Technology moves faster than I do.
52100	52820	Me too.
53300	53780	You too.
54580	59820	It won't be long before we're all Luddites.
63780	67060	Buckeletric Albertiola I discussed at Davis.
68320	75320	It's probably Albertiata, but there's many other species that look almost identical to it.
75320	80380	Anyway, I did get a few in the text. I'll bring them in.
80800	82480	Just, I just made up some way.
82480	87680	Powell said that there is another species on oak that's similar to Alberti yellow.
87680	95380	But I think I have that one as buccolatrix number such and such in my backyard.
95380	104320	The ones that I call buccolatrix number one or two or three in my yard are different than the one, two, and three at Cold Canyon.
104320	123000	So it's interesting to me that we have both buccolatrix ceanothiella and separabilis here because what I was calling separabilis is ceanothiella.
123000	126500	It was misidentification, and I gave you a correction.
127020	129680	But when I look here and here, these are the same.
131420	132340	So that's why.
132660	133020	That's why.
133120	133700	It's just a duplicate.
133700	140060	To replace separabilis with ceanothiella in your, for both, I think there's one Davis record.
141560	149200	They're both kind of a white, tiny white moth with black markings, but they're very different from one another once you see the pictures.
150200	160440	But I didn't have the pictures until recently, and I knew separabilis, which is on coyote bush, from the coast, and I assume that's what we had.
160440	165400	But, you know, ceanothus is everywhere, so.
165860	166400	Mm-hmm.
167040	168240	Yeah, it's ornamental.
168500	172040	So that's a discrepancy there.
174700	175740	We'll fix it.
175960	183380	And the rest of these buccolatrix are ones that I just assigned a number to.
183380	197840	The one that I call buccolatrix tawny or something turned out to be a tishereid, and I think they've all been changed, but I can't say that with certainty.
200240	206880	Bucolatrix have what they call eye caps, and that's expanded scales at the base of antennae over the eyes.
206960	207960	Yeah, I love those so much.
208020	208900	They look like little puppies.
208900	217220	And tishereids do not, and that's why I was always suspicious about that so-called tawny albertio.
217560	218300	Where are we?
218680	219560	So, her favorite word.
219720	220980	Bucolatrix, you name it, yeah.
220980	221020	Puppy.
221620	226200	She just wakes up all morning, she says, puppy, puppy, puppy.
226420	227880	Yesterday, she called a bird a puppy.
229140	231040	My daughter's learning new words.
231540	232340	That's so cute.
232340	239100	The chaleptilia species slash species bee is probably more than one species.
239600	257060	And these are all kind of, chaleptilia in general is an enormous genus found in many, maybe in every hemisphere of the world.
257060	283820	And they're leaf miners that later make, most of which later make like a cone-shaped shelter on the same food plant in which they finish feeding, make their cocoon and pupa, and then emerge.
283820	294260	And they stand on, with their forelegs stiffened and their tails sitting back.
294520	299980	So, they're very easy to recognize on the sheet, even though they're tiny, longs.
301340	307400	Species bee are all the ones that are kind of a, yeah, that's the posture.
307960	309220	They look like tiger beetles.
311220	311960	The way they sit.
311980	312180	No, I don't know.
312180	319920	It may be that most of these things that have kind of a peculiar posture or eye spots and everything are thought to be mimicking spiders.
320660	321060	Interesting.
321260	321620	Yeah, yeah.
321720	322500	I see that.
322620	324180	I mean, the legs look a lot like spiders.
324280	326980	Other times, it's because they want to look twig-like.
327400	328900	So, I don't know.
333860	336080	The ones that I call bee are like this.
336180	337400	They're kind of brown here.
337400	341640	And then these little tick marks along the leading edge of the wing.
343880	345240	That's a funny-looking moth.
345240	348020	This is what, Wagner particularly liked these when he was in magic school.
348020	349140	I think it's like a little tripod.
349500	350260	I like it, too.
350420	350540	Yeah.
350540	356280	So, I recorded a number of the ones that look like that as this.
356280	362280	And a couple of species were distinct and recorded by name or as some other thing.
362280	368760	Like, there was a black one that we reared from ash only once.
369400	375440	And there's a name for one called, there's a name for a calyptelia on ash called Fraxinella, of course.
375440	380680	And that does not seem to be the species we have out here.
380840	389100	But it's an enormous genus with many undescribed species and many that are difficult to tell apart.
389540	399940	And very little available to the amateur to just differentiate them.
400340	401120	Do you think they're native?
401660	402060	Pardon me?
402140	403000	Do you think they're native?
403000	405800	Probably, because they're leafminers.
406040	406180	Okay.
406900	410500	And most leafminers are highly specialized.
410880	411140	Mm-hmm.
411560	412160	Okay.
412220	416300	Sometimes even to the species within a larger genus.
416580	416840	Mm-hmm.
421720	423940	Choradrina postacella.
424340	428720	This is a recent change in the genus.
428720	430880	I don't know.
430960	434860	It's a noctuit and I don't know much about the biology.
439280	446040	I don't think this is one that's covered in any of the fascicles on noctuits.
447380	448320	But it could be.
449220	451980	If it is, it's probably under the old generic name.
451980	452660	Oh, nice.
452660	453840	I just fell back.
453840	453860	I just fell back.
453860	454240	I don't know.
454240	454920	Yeah.
454920	455680	We do have a shift in the...
455680	459020	Catacula ilia zoe.
459020	459120	Oh, okay.
459120	464860	Catacula ilia has...
464860	468060	Catacula are the underwing walls, you know, with the bright colors.
468300	471040	So it's thought to be aposematic.
471400	473720	You know, they flash this and cut it together.
473720	484480	Catacula ilia has red hindwings with the black loops in it.
485840	493360	But zoe, the western one, has yellow-orange hindwings.
493360	503040	And that makes it very similar to another species that is reported from this area.
504340	505940	And all the ones...
505940	512500	I didn't realize that there were these two very similar species and I didn't make any comparisons.
512500	517340	So it's possible that not all of these are this one species.
517340	524800	And the other species, I'd have to look at them to see what the name of it is.
525000	531040	But like Shapiro and a number of other people have reported seeing this to me from time to...
531040	532960	The other species from time to time.
533240	539920	And I've always wondered whether they think that ilia always has red hindwings and it's a misidentification.
540280	543080	But the other one seems to be out here.
544540	545060	Directly.
545060	547900	Catacula is very popular.
548300	550100	See how it has a red hindwing there?
550340	551140	Yeah, it's a handsome wall.
551140	552700	But that's not the case out here.
552860	553120	Okay.
554440	559620	But the pattern of the forewings is different than the pattern of the other one.
559920	564380	It's different, but not startlingly different.
565460	566940	Houseplant? Native? Non-native?
567500	570000	I think most Catacula are native.
570000	575320	And I think all of them feed on trees and shrubs.
575320	578020	And I don't know how host-specific they are.
578520	580040	Popular with collectors.
581040	581160	Yes.
581160	593320	Variliana is the more common species of Catacula with a red hindwing.
595000	596500	It's a smaller one.
596500	606180	I'm surprised some of the other species didn't show up in sufficient abundance to make the list.
606180	612780	Often, you know, they're very strong flyers.
613700	618120	And often what happens is they come in, hit the sheet, they fly off, never to return.
619120	626080	And I think that could be the case with a lot of fast-flying moths.
626080	634640	And, you know, it doesn't make me upset because often they come back later, but not always.
637540	639020	Cyanotes brownella.
639760	641760	Cyanotes is a chelikea.
642120	648660	Another one with the wings flat across the back of the body.
648660	653860	And it's known to be on lupins.
654800	657260	And I don't know what other food plants.
657320	662240	I never reared it myself, but it's one of the more common ones at Cold Canyon.
662700	664400	But I've never seen it at Davis.
665900	666960	Yep, yep, I see it.
670000	671560	Cyanotes johnstidae.
671560	677200	There was another species that looks very much like this called Cyanotes restio.
678800	683000	And it kind of disappeared.
683540	687900	And this, which is similar, showed up about the same time.
689800	692200	Well, this one looks like it disappeared here.
693740	695040	Could be, yeah.
695040	703760	But it could be also that this restio and Cyanotes powoli are all similar.
704220	714740	Males of Cyanotes powoli have some secondary sex characteristic on the wings that makes them easy to identify.
715060	716660	But the females of all the species.
717960	719800	But restio completely disappeared.
719800	736800	And I know it was true restio because the guy who did the Mona revision, monograph on Cyanotes, designated one of my Cold Canyon specimens as a paratype.
738800	743600	So, and I think they all feed on oaks.
743600	748180	All of those three species.
748340	751060	I mentioned Cyanotes, but there's a lot of Cyanotes.
751940	756300	So, do you think that this dropping off could just be misidentification?
757080	769300	I think it's possible that once I recognized powoli as a common species, and didn't dissect as many of them,
769300	774960	I started calling more of them Johnstoni, or powoli, unless they were males.
775560	781360	So, females is kind of a crapshoot as to whether I identified them correctly.
781520	783140	But male, powoli.
783140	790320	So, we should probably collapse powoli and johnstoni and call them either or?
790760	796120	Are there any of the other Cyanotes that we should include in that lumped category?
796120	803740	Well, I don't know whether your intention is to lump them for the purposes of analysis.
804060	807180	Yeah, so it would be like, if we can't...
807180	808580	But I kind of think that's a bad idea.
809240	812040	Because the phenology may be very different.
812140	816280	But in this case, since they all feed on oaks, that could be real.
816420	824440	But it could be that there's a phenomenon going on where one outcompetes the others on oaks during some years.
824440	824760	Okay.
825560	828500	See, and there's the danger if you lump them together.
828640	829420	Yeah, okay.
830680	834280	But that's an opinion, and, you know, ultimately the decisions are yours.
834960	840260	Okay, so do you think that any of these other Cyanotes could be, like, you...
840260	841100	Confused with it?
841280	841460	Yeah.
841680	844560	There are other species which I haven't listed, but have...
844560	846280	There's one called Petalumansus.
847340	849380	There's one Occidentalis.
849700	852040	There's some other ones that are very similar to it.
852180	852340	Okay.
852400	857820	If you want, you can look at the pictures on MPG and just say California.
857820	864640	And look to see which species are identical to one another and which ones are in our area.
864640	872340	And then, if you want, you can download the monograph and see which ones are oak feeders.
872900	878260	But it doesn't really matter because when you collect them on the sheet, if they look like other species,
878260	884220	their whole plant is irrelevant, if you might confuse them with one another.
888800	898380	But Restia looks more like Johnstidae than either of them look like Palolai.
898380	908960	But Jerry wrote in his book that Palolai is the most common species on oaks.
909940	914760	But I think that was based upon the sites that he collected.
917320	919380	Oh, Bellis is a...
920500	922720	Well, let's skip it for a minute because here's Palolai.
922720	928640	And you can see Palolai went from nothing to frequent.
929640	930240	And that could be...
930240	931420	You did that in Davis, too.
932420	932720	Yeah.
934880	940420	But I didn't get the similar species in Davis before I started getting Palolai.
940780	943000	And Palolai is there very common.
943620	947960	You know, there's that species I'm calling Galachia number two in Davis.
948240	950840	And I have lots and lots of records.
950840	955000	And now I'm beginning to lean towards that that's a Kayanodes.
956120	957380	But I could be wrong.
958760	970880	And, you know, what I need to do if it is Kayanodes is check to see whether it's one of these species that vanished
970880	975280	because I forgot how to recognize it.
975280	979820	So here's Palolai and going back to a Bellis.
979880	982520	I think a Bellis is a Ceanothus feeder.
984040	990680	It's a small one, drab, brown.
992560	994560	Very few distinguishing features.
994560	997520	So I dissected a number of them.
997760	1007220	And there's another species which only differs in small details of the genitalia.
1007320	1014700	But I could see them clear enough to know that the small ones here that I dissected were all this one species.
1014700	1020120	So here's Rustio.
1020360	1025040	I'm surprised that there's that many late records.
1025040	1029940	Okay, I'm going to stop us.
1029940	1059920	I'm going to stop us.
