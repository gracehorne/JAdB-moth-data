1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,500
All right, recording number two, December 18th.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,140
There are other species of Japanulatrix, and I think, you know, most of them are Western,

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,140
and I think all of them, even the ones that are not in our area, feed on various species of Cyanothis.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,680
I just got through you in a calculator.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,520
And there are some that are coastal,

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,140
and some of the specimens that I collected looked like one of the coastal species,

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,480
and I dissected a few of them, and they turned out not to be that species.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,420
And then there's a Sierra one that's fairly common, and some of our individuals look like that.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,820
So I think most of them are recorded correctly, but it's a difficult genus,

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,300
and I know that it's impossible to say that mistakes haven't been made.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,940
It would be an outright lie, I think.

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,320
Dysareocrania auriciania is an areocrania,

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,860
so one of the most primitive families of Lepidoptera.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,420
They call them mandibulate moths.

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:30,340
They don't have functional mandibles, but they have non-functional remnants of mandibles as adults.

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,400
It feeds on oaks.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,940
They come to light.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,020
I've got this species one time in my backyard.

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,900
And when you have to be there at just the right time to get them.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:54,520
So I think there's probably fairly uniform, but they do.

21
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:02,340
It is a leaf mining species, so it could be subject to crashes due to parasitism from time to time.

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,640
But if you're there at the right time, sometimes there's quite a few on the sheet.

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,580
Do you mean right time of year or right time of night?

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,260
Right time when the adults are active at the right time of year.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,760
They fly early in the year, which could account for absence in some years of the data.

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,820
But at one time I was looking to get some because Bob Kinsey was anxious to get some.

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,540
And like many moths, once you try to get them, they go into hiding.

28
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:48,240
There's one other area, Crineid species, that's less common at Cold Canyon, and it didn't make the list.

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,720
And I decided to change its identification at some point during the survey.

30
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,160
I think I've only got it two or three times.

31
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,460
Dystroma emancipated.

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,100
Dystroma is a difficult genus.

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,860
And adults are variable.

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,260
This could be more than one species.

35
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:21,340
And the smallest ones, Ron Neuschner, who identified a number of moths for me,

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,860
called the smaller ones by a different name.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,600
I think Covelli, just the same as the street here.

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:41,720
And I'm not sure whether those are just runts of emancipated or they are a different species.

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:51,780
And I think that to be certain about identification requires dissections.

40
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:01,480
But it's very common moth, although not in Davis, and highly variable.

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,340
And I don't know where one species ends and another one begins.

42
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:14,540
And I've just been calling them emancipated because that was the first name that was given to me for ones of average size.

43
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:23,960
The gyra, there's several species here.

44
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,380
These are all early moths, I believe.

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,540
Early in the year?

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,020
They're winter moths.

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,180
The adults are active in the winter.

48
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,820
And I believe all of them feed on trees and shrubs.

49
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,500
And I believe all of these are native species.

50
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,860
How do they feed on trees and shrubs?

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Is it evergreen trees and shrubs?

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,800
I think they're just external feeders.

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,960
And they just, they don't make shelters or anything.

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,260
Oh, because the caterpillars are not out, the adults are out.

55
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay, I understand.

56
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,740
I mean, they're noctuits, so they're grub-like worms.

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:19,500
And Crucialis, there's a species that some illustrations look similar to Crucialis.

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,620
But, and people who have gone to Cold Canyon have sent me records of that similar-looking species.

59
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,160
But I'm not convinced, you know, in all the years I went there, I never collected that species.

60
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,560
And I'm not convinced that those reports that were given to me are correctly identified specimens.

61
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:56,180
Curialis is similar to a moth in a different genus, but once you learn to tell them apart.

62
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,460
Okay, but I could have made some mistakes in the early years.

63
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,180
But, you know, there's two problems there.

64
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,100
One, if they're similar to other moths.

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,480
And two, if they're winter moths, they may be under-collected.

66
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,060
Hemolus is the most common one.

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,720
And I started recording it much more frequently in Davis than I did in the early years.

68
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:31,060
And I think this last year, or 23, it was more common than ever before.

69
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,100
So, I don't know, when you see patterns like that,

70
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,740
I don't know whether it means they've become established in my neighborhood or that it's a population cycle.

71
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,100
Or because it's a winter moth, I just didn't have records.

72
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,140
Perlubins is fairly easy to identify.

73
00:06:50,140 --> 00:07:01,800
Mariah Robinson did that paper where she reared a lot of moths in the McLaughlin Reserve.

74
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:11,000
And if you can dig out that paper, there's probably some host plant records for at least the macro moths.

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Do you, there's this period before 2000 where you didn't see this.

76
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,800
Do you think that's a true, like they weren't there, or?

77
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,260
Well, this is an easily recognized moth.

78
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:36,060
But I think it's possible, too, that this is a moth that's much more common on the upper trail.

79
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Generally, in the early months, there's two places that I collect.

81
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:53,200
In the earliest years, I collected almost exclusively right at that log-in site on the lower trail.

82
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,640
But then when I realized it was so damn cold there in the winter months,

83
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,540
I started just collecting at the gate right at the highway.

84
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:12,380
And there, collecting was much better because all the cold air that's settling in the lower parts of the canyon

85
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:21,500
are further up the trail or down the trail, depending on whether you say down south and up north,

86
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,060
out west and back east.

87
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:38,260
So, the early years may be not represented because I was collecting in that colder locality.

88
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:46,340
And then even in recent years, I collected either at the lower gate or just inside the gate on the west trail,

89
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,840
you know, which is where I collected any time I collected on the west trail,

90
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
except for once or twice I went further up the trail.

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,420
I mean, that's kind of a problem you have with the data from Cold Canyon.

92
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,500
It's collected all over the place and, you know, little things make a difference.

93
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,100
If I put the sheet this way, I get different things.

94
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,460
And if I put it that way, even in the same smoke.

95
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:22,140
So, you know, when you're trying to get as many different species as you can, that's not important.

96
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
You just don't care how you got them.

97
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,980
You just want to add them to the list.

98
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,280
Agyra rubrica, I got once in Davis,

99
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:41,060
and it was periodically encountered in reasonable numbers at Cold Canyon,

100
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
but it was not one of the more common species.

101
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,560
And then there was one or two that I got only once or twice.

102
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,160
And I think those species tended to be more coastal,

103
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,340
and they occasionally spill over.

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,140
There's one called Febriolus, which is not here.

105
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,700
And that one, some years, it seemed to me, was in reasonable numbers.

106
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,380
The problem is, you know, if I only go there once during every half-month period,

107
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:16,040
it's not the same as going there ten times during that half-month period in a year when they're flying.

108
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:25,920
And that kind of gives you an erroneous indication of how common the species is.

109
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Eidophasia vanilla used to be, it's in Plutality.

110
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,240
It used to be Plutella vanilla, which is much more fun to say than Eidophasia vanilla.

111
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,580
And its food plant is known, and it's in the literature.

112
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:58,380
I got this once in Davis, and it's a very distinct moth, brown and white,

113
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,140
kind of a harlequin pattern.

114
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,780
It's, you can't confuse it with anything else.

115
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,200
But it was always, it's one of these, it's kind of pleasing to see,

116
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,580
because it has a more colorful than a little brown or a little gray moth.

117
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,640
So I would tend to collect them when they did come to life,

118
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,900
and record them, and identify them correctly.

119
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,920
Amylina monodactyla is the pterophorid that feeds on Morning Glory

120
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,220
and that family of plants.

121
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,520
It's a variable moth, and I think it's a monotypic genus.

122
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:52,220
And I found an old key on that subfamily of pterophorids,

123
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:59,900
and it gave a character, an external character on the legs as diagnostic,

124
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,880
like a tuft of scales or something like that.

125
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,680
I'd have to look to see what it was.

126
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:14,540
But the moth itself varies from kind of a dingy white to a soft brown.

127
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,460
But once you get a feeling on it, but it could be confused with other species

128
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,620
and some of the other related pterophorid genera.

129
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,760
They're a place throughout the year.

130
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,340
And as I said before, it seems that pterophorids are not strongly attracted to light.

131
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:49,360
And so that is something that suggests that what you're saying here is what comes to light,

132
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,000
and it may underrepresent species that don't come to light.

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,540
That's why there's not many butterflies, and diurnal moth.

134
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,000
Endothenia hebezena is...

135
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I think this is a...

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,660
Maybe it's an Olethrutine tortricid.

137
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,320
And I'm on the danger of confusing it with another species.

138
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,860
I think this is the one that's on paintbrush.

139
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,480
And I've reared it a number of times.

140
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,600
When I come to the other species, I'll look this up when I get...

141
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay.

142
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,920
Look at your notes and make sure that I'm doing it right.

143
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,980
So I'm going to just quit at this point in discussing something.

144
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:54,220
Can you resume telling us which ones you know about, if they're native or non-native, or if you're unsure?

145
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,100
Yeah.

146
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,380
Because you're telling us sometimes, and I forgot to ask you.

147
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,080
Let me do it this way.

148
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:09,840
By default, I will point out non-native species if I know that they're non-native.

149
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,280
Okay.

150
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,420
But, you know, just the other day I was cleaning up some of the clutter in my house,

151
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:22,700
and I found a reprint of a paper that Jerry Powell wrote on Bactra.

152
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,540
Remember, that was the Torturism that Feeds on Reeds.

153
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,320
And the title of the paper was,

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,220
New Species of Bactra, One Possibly Non-Native.

155
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,260
So he speculated that one of those species was non-native.

156
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,820
It was not any of the ones that we collected.

157
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,900
There was another interesting story about one of those species, but I won't talk about it now.

158
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,320
Ephesia cuneiello, I discussed at Davis.

159
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,040
Okay.

160
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,140
We can skip it.

161
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:01,260
It declined greatly in numbers in Davis in recent years, and I don't know why that is.

162
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,680
It's either, but it could be, you know, these are physitines, and they're all similar to one another.

163
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:18,920
And I may have misidentified some as this species in the beginning and then learned that they were something else,

164
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,860
but that's speculation.

165
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,160
All these surveys were a learn-it-should-go type of thing for me.

166
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:39,320
So, Ephesiodes erythrella is not the false raisin moth, as you wrote down here,

167
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,100
but it's in the same genus as the false raisin moth.

168
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,420
Okay.

169
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,720
The false raisin moth is the next one, Gilda Centella.

170
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:48,960
Okay.

171
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,300
And erythrella is a darker moth with some brick red coloration on it.

172
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:07,220
And it shows up in modest numbers some years and not at all in other years.

173
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,160
So I think this is real.

174
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:18,080
It's one that, once I realized that the ones that had this brick red coloration and were darker would not Gilda Centella,

175
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,240
I was able to record accurately from then on.

176
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,940
And I determined that fairly early in the survey, and I did some dissections and made slides,

177
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:38,820
which you need to do to see the subtle differences in genitalia and confirm that we have both species.

178
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:50,820
But Gilda Centella is the most common moth in Davis and one of the most common small moths at Coltenham as well.

179
00:16:50,820 --> 00:17:02,820
This is one, I think I told you this story before, that sometimes I've had individuals in my relaxer

180
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,940
where I put things before I spread them, and they lay eggs even though they're dead.

181
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,140
Dead? That's crazy.

182
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,260
And then those caterpillars get out and eat the other moths.

183
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:22,200
So I think these species of erythrella are kind of scavengers and opportunistic feeders.

184
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,600
Detritus scavengers, stored product foods.

185
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:37,760
So occasional pests, but they're not as serious as things like Indian meal moth and the other pantry moths.

186
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
There's Epinodia emarginana.

187
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,400
There's several species of epinodia here.

188
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,600
Emarginana feeds on oaks.

189
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:57,020
And it's recognizable because the edges of the wigs, extreme edge of the wigs,

190
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,100
the apical edge of the wigs, have an indentation.

191
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,280
They're emarginate.

192
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,020
That's where the name comes from.

193
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:14,520
But there's another species on mountain mahogany, Cercocarpus, that also has that notch.

194
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:25,580
And Cercocarpus is kind of up on, mostly up on the west-facing slope.

195
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:32,020
So, I did collect some larvae on Cercocarpus and reared them.

196
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,660
But the problem is, sometimes they spin down from oaks and pupate on other things.

197
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,980
But Powell confirmed that I do have the species from Cercocarpus as well.

198
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,820
I think it's Cercocarpana, strangely enough.

199
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:58,880
And marginana is, it seems to emerge in late spring, early summer.

200
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,200
That's when you get really fresh-looking individuals.

201
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,400
But you get adults year-round, including, you know, I found them in my house on New Year's Day one time.

202
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,120
You know what?

203
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:20,320
So, they overwinter as adults and then lay their eggs in just before the new flush of leaves on live oaks, especially.

204
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,640
Are they, um, miners?

205
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,680
Pardon me?

206
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,420
Are they miners?

207
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,380
No, they're leaf.

208
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,640
Tortrissas.

209
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,360
Leaf rollers.

210
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,060
Most tortrissas are leaf rollers.

211
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,900
But this is in the oaks rutines.

212
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:42,560
And oaks rutines tend to have more internal feeders than do the tortricines, the other, one of the other sub-famines.

213
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,220
Okay.
