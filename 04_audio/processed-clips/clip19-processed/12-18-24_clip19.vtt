WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:03.500
All right, recording number two, December 18th.

00:03.600 --> 00:10.140
There are other species of Japanulatrix, and I think, you know, most of them are Western,

00:10.380 --> 00:17.140
and I think all of them, even the ones that are not in our area, feed on various species of Cyanothis.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.680
I just got through you in a calculator.

00:20.980 --> 00:25.520
And there are some that are coastal,

00:25.520 --> 00:31.140
and some of the specimens that I collected looked like one of the coastal species,

00:31.440 --> 00:35.480
and I dissected a few of them, and they turned out not to be that species.

00:36.700 --> 00:43.420
And then there's a Sierra one that's fairly common, and some of our individuals look like that.

00:45.660 --> 00:52.820
So I think most of them are recorded correctly, but it's a difficult genus,

00:52.820 --> 00:59.300
and I know that it's impossible to say that mistakes haven't been made.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.940
It would be an outright lie, I think.

01:07.820 --> 01:12.320
Dysareocrania auriciania is an areocrania,

01:12.460 --> 01:16.860
so one of the most primitive families of Lepidoptera.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.420
They call them mandibulate moths.

01:19.420 --> 01:30.340
They don't have functional mandibles, but they have non-functional remnants of mandibles as adults.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.400
It feeds on oaks.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.940
They come to light.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.020
I've got this species one time in my backyard.

01:39.020 --> 01:46.900
And when you have to be there at just the right time to get them.

01:46.900 --> 01:54.520
So I think there's probably fairly uniform, but they do.

01:54.940 --> 02:02.340
It is a leaf mining species, so it could be subject to crashes due to parasitism from time to time.

02:02.340 --> 02:07.640
But if you're there at the right time, sometimes there's quite a few on the sheet.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.580
Do you mean right time of year or right time of night?

02:11.640 --> 02:14.260
Right time when the adults are active at the right time of year.

02:14.320 --> 02:20.760
They fly early in the year, which could account for absence in some years of the data.

02:20.760 --> 02:27.820
But at one time I was looking to get some because Bob Kinsey was anxious to get some.

02:28.100 --> 02:33.540
And like many moths, once you try to get them, they go into hiding.

02:33.540 --> 02:48.240
There's one other area, Crineid species, that's less common at Cold Canyon, and it didn't make the list.

02:49.100 --> 02:55.720
And I decided to change its identification at some point during the survey.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.160
I think I've only got it two or three times.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.460
Dystroma emancipated.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.100
Dystroma is a difficult genus.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.860
And adults are variable.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.260
This could be more than one species.

03:13.460 --> 03:21.340
And the smallest ones, Ron Neuschner, who identified a number of moths for me,

03:23.800 --> 03:26.860
called the smaller ones by a different name.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.600
I think Covelli, just the same as the street here.

03:31.600 --> 03:41.720
And I'm not sure whether those are just runts of emancipated or they are a different species.

03:41.720 --> 03:51.780
And I think that to be certain about identification requires dissections.

03:51.780 --> 04:01.480
But it's very common moth, although not in Davis, and highly variable.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.340
And I don't know where one species ends and another one begins.

04:05.340 --> 04:14.540
And I've just been calling them emancipated because that was the first name that was given to me for ones of average size.

04:14.540 --> 04:23.960
The gyra, there's several species here.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.380
These are all early moths, I believe.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.540
Early in the year?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.020
They're winter moths.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.180
The adults are active in the winter.

04:33.180 --> 04:39.820
And I believe all of them feed on trees and shrubs.

04:40.820 --> 04:43.500
And I believe all of these are native species.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.860
How do they feed on trees and shrubs?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.200
Is it evergreen trees and shrubs?

04:51.720 --> 04:53.800
I think they're just external feeders.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.960
And they just, they don't make shelters or anything.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.260
Oh, because the caterpillars are not out, the adults are out.

05:00.340 --> 05:00.880
Okay, I understand.

05:01.060 --> 05:05.740
I mean, they're noctuits, so they're grub-like worms.

05:08.360 --> 05:19.500
And Crucialis, there's a species that some illustrations look similar to Crucialis.

05:19.500 --> 05:27.620
But, and people who have gone to Cold Canyon have sent me records of that similar-looking species.

05:28.460 --> 05:34.160
But I'm not convinced, you know, in all the years I went there, I never collected that species.

05:34.520 --> 05:42.560
And I'm not convinced that those reports that were given to me are correctly identified specimens.

05:42.560 --> 05:56.180
Curialis is similar to a moth in a different genus, but once you learn to tell them apart.

05:57.260 --> 06:01.460
Okay, but I could have made some mistakes in the early years.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.180
But, you know, there's two problems there.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.100
One, if they're similar to other moths.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.480
And two, if they're winter moths, they may be under-collected.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.060
Hemolus is the most common one.

06:17.360 --> 06:23.720
And I started recording it much more frequently in Davis than I did in the early years.

06:23.960 --> 06:31.060
And I think this last year, or 23, it was more common than ever before.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.100
So, I don't know, when you see patterns like that,

06:35.100 --> 06:40.740
I don't know whether it means they've become established in my neighborhood or that it's a population cycle.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.100
Or because it's a winter moth, I just didn't have records.

06:46.900 --> 06:50.140
Perlubins is fairly easy to identify.

06:50.140 --> 07:01.800
Mariah Robinson did that paper where she reared a lot of moths in the McLaughlin Reserve.

07:02.340 --> 07:11.000
And if you can dig out that paper, there's probably some host plant records for at least the macro moths.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.800
Do you, there's this period before 2000 where you didn't see this.

07:18.880 --> 07:24.800
Do you think that's a true, like they weren't there, or?

07:25.060 --> 07:27.260
Well, this is an easily recognized moth.

07:27.420 --> 07:36.060
But I think it's possible, too, that this is a moth that's much more common on the upper trail.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.000
Okay.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.840
Generally, in the early months, there's two places that I collect.

07:42.580 --> 07:53.200
In the earliest years, I collected almost exclusively right at that log-in site on the lower trail.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.640
But then when I realized it was so damn cold there in the winter months,

07:57.840 --> 08:02.540
I started just collecting at the gate right at the highway.

08:02.540 --> 08:12.380
And there, collecting was much better because all the cold air that's settling in the lower parts of the canyon

08:12.380 --> 08:21.500
are further up the trail or down the trail, depending on whether you say down south and up north,

08:22.360 --> 08:25.060
out west and back east.

08:25.060 --> 08:38.260
So, the early years may be not represented because I was collecting in that colder locality.

08:39.420 --> 08:46.340
And then even in recent years, I collected either at the lower gate or just inside the gate on the west trail,

08:46.340 --> 08:50.840
you know, which is where I collected any time I collected on the west trail,

08:51.040 --> 08:54.000
except for once or twice I went further up the trail.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.420
I mean, that's kind of a problem you have with the data from Cold Canyon.

09:02.720 --> 09:09.500
It's collected all over the place and, you know, little things make a difference.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.100
If I put the sheet this way, I get different things.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.460
And if I put it that way, even in the same smoke.

09:14.460 --> 09:22.140
So, you know, when you're trying to get as many different species as you can, that's not important.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.380
You just don't care how you got them.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.980
You just want to add them to the list.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.280
Agyra rubrica, I got once in Davis,

09:32.280 --> 09:41.060
and it was periodically encountered in reasonable numbers at Cold Canyon,

09:41.180 --> 09:43.180
but it was not one of the more common species.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.560
And then there was one or two that I got only once or twice.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.160
And I think those species tended to be more coastal,

09:51.620 --> 09:54.340
and they occasionally spill over.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.140
There's one called Febriolus, which is not here.

09:58.040 --> 10:02.700
And that one, some years, it seemed to me, was in reasonable numbers.

10:03.700 --> 10:09.380
The problem is, you know, if I only go there once during every half-month period,

10:09.380 --> 10:16.040
it's not the same as going there ten times during that half-month period in a year when they're flying.

10:16.040 --> 10:25.920
And that kind of gives you an erroneous indication of how common the species is.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.100
Eidophasia vanilla used to be, it's in Plutality.

10:35.960 --> 10:41.240
It used to be Plutella vanilla, which is much more fun to say than Eidophasia vanilla.

10:41.240 --> 10:46.580
And its food plant is known, and it's in the literature.

10:47.120 --> 10:58.380
I got this once in Davis, and it's a very distinct moth, brown and white,

10:58.380 --> 11:02.140
kind of a harlequin pattern.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.780
It's, you can't confuse it with anything else.

11:07.260 --> 11:12.200
But it was always, it's one of these, it's kind of pleasing to see,

11:12.300 --> 11:16.580
because it has a more colorful than a little brown or a little gray moth.

11:17.220 --> 11:20.640
So I would tend to collect them when they did come to life,

11:20.740 --> 11:23.900
and record them, and identify them correctly.

11:23.900 --> 11:31.920
Amylina monodactyla is the pterophorid that feeds on Morning Glory

11:31.920 --> 11:36.220
and that family of plants.

11:36.780 --> 11:42.520
It's a variable moth, and I think it's a monotypic genus.

11:42.520 --> 11:52.220
And I found an old key on that subfamily of pterophorids,

11:52.460 --> 11:59.900
and it gave a character, an external character on the legs as diagnostic,

12:00.400 --> 12:02.880
like a tuft of scales or something like that.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.680
I'd have to look to see what it was.

12:04.680 --> 12:14.540
But the moth itself varies from kind of a dingy white to a soft brown.

12:16.840 --> 12:22.460
But once you get a feeling on it, but it could be confused with other species

12:22.460 --> 12:28.620
and some of the other related pterophorid genera.

12:28.620 --> 12:33.760
They're a place throughout the year.

12:34.060 --> 12:39.340
And as I said before, it seems that pterophorids are not strongly attracted to light.

12:40.780 --> 12:49.360
And so that is something that suggests that what you're saying here is what comes to light,

12:49.420 --> 12:53.000
and it may underrepresent species that don't come to light.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.540
That's why there's not many butterflies, and diurnal moth.

12:59.060 --> 13:02.000
Endothenia hebezena is...

13:02.000 --> 13:12.000
I think this is a...

13:12.000 --> 13:16.660
Maybe it's an Olethrutine tortricid.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.320
And I'm on the danger of confusing it with another species.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.860
I think this is the one that's on paintbrush.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.480
And I've reared it a number of times.

13:36.300 --> 13:40.600
When I come to the other species, I'll look this up when I get...

13:40.600 --> 13:40.780
Okay.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.920
Look at your notes and make sure that I'm doing it right.

13:44.180 --> 13:46.980
So I'm going to just quit at this point in discussing something.

13:46.980 --> 13:54.220
Can you resume telling us which ones you know about, if they're native or non-native, or if you're unsure?

13:54.820 --> 13:55.100
Yeah.

13:55.220 --> 13:57.380
Because you're telling us sometimes, and I forgot to ask you.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.080
Let me do it this way.

14:00.080 --> 14:09.840
By default, I will point out non-native species if I know that they're non-native.

14:10.100 --> 14:10.280
Okay.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.420
But, you know, just the other day I was cleaning up some of the clutter in my house,

14:14.420 --> 14:22.700
and I found a reprint of a paper that Jerry Powell wrote on Bactra.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.540
Remember, that was the Torturism that Feeds on Reeds.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.320
And the title of the paper was,

14:29.280 --> 14:33.220
New Species of Bactra, One Possibly Non-Native.

14:33.220 --> 14:37.260
So he speculated that one of those species was non-native.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.820
It was not any of the ones that we collected.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.900
There was another interesting story about one of those species, but I won't talk about it now.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.320
Ephesia cuneiello, I discussed at Davis.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.040
Okay.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.140
We can skip it.

14:54.780 --> 15:01.260
It declined greatly in numbers in Davis in recent years, and I don't know why that is.

15:01.260 --> 15:07.680
It's either, but it could be, you know, these are physitines, and they're all similar to one another.

15:08.540 --> 15:18.920
And I may have misidentified some as this species in the beginning and then learned that they were something else,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.860
but that's speculation.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.160
All these surveys were a learn-it-should-go type of thing for me.

15:29.160 --> 15:39.320
So, Ephesiodes erythrella is not the false raisin moth, as you wrote down here,

15:39.400 --> 15:43.100
but it's in the same genus as the false raisin moth.

15:45.040 --> 15:45.420
Okay.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.720
The false raisin moth is the next one, Gilda Centella.

15:48.720 --> 15:48.960
Okay.

15:49.960 --> 15:56.300
And erythrella is a darker moth with some brick red coloration on it.

15:56.300 --> 16:07.220
And it shows up in modest numbers some years and not at all in other years.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.160
So I think this is real.

16:09.940 --> 16:18.080
It's one that, once I realized that the ones that had this brick red coloration and were darker would not Gilda Centella,

16:18.080 --> 16:23.240
I was able to record accurately from then on.

16:23.560 --> 16:30.940
And I determined that fairly early in the survey, and I did some dissections and made slides,

16:31.020 --> 16:38.820
which you need to do to see the subtle differences in genitalia and confirm that we have both species.

16:38.820 --> 16:50.820
But Gilda Centella is the most common moth in Davis and one of the most common small moths at Coltenham as well.

16:50.820 --> 17:02.820
This is one, I think I told you this story before, that sometimes I've had individuals in my relaxer

17:02.820 --> 17:07.940
where I put things before I spread them, and they lay eggs even though they're dead.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.140
Dead? That's crazy.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.260
And then those caterpillars get out and eat the other moths.

17:12.260 --> 17:22.200
So I think these species of erythrella are kind of scavengers and opportunistic feeders.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.600
Detritus scavengers, stored product foods.

17:27.420 --> 17:37.760
So occasional pests, but they're not as serious as things like Indian meal moth and the other pantry moths.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.320
There's Epinodia emarginana.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.400
There's several species of epinodia here.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.600
Emarginana feeds on oaks.

17:48.440 --> 17:57.020
And it's recognizable because the edges of the wigs, extreme edge of the wigs,

17:58.100 --> 18:02.100
the apical edge of the wigs, have an indentation.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.280
They're emarginate.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.020
That's where the name comes from.

18:06.020 --> 18:14.520
But there's another species on mountain mahogany, Cercocarpus, that also has that notch.

18:16.020 --> 18:25.580
And Cercocarpus is kind of up on, mostly up on the west-facing slope.

18:25.580 --> 18:32.020
So, I did collect some larvae on Cercocarpus and reared them.

18:32.140 --> 18:38.660
But the problem is, sometimes they spin down from oaks and pupate on other things.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.980
But Powell confirmed that I do have the species from Cercocarpus as well.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.820
I think it's Cercocarpana, strangely enough.

18:47.820 --> 18:58.880
And marginana is, it seems to emerge in late spring, early summer.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.200
That's when you get really fresh-looking individuals.

19:02.200 --> 19:08.400
But you get adults year-round, including, you know, I found them in my house on New Year's Day one time.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.120
You know what?

19:09.120 --> 19:20.320
So, they overwinter as adults and then lay their eggs in just before the new flush of leaves on live oaks, especially.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.640
Are they, um, miners?

19:24.320 --> 19:24.680
Pardon me?

19:24.740 --> 19:25.420
Are they miners?

19:25.500 --> 19:26.380
No, they're leaf.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.640
Tortrissas.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.360
Leaf rollers.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.060
Most tortrissas are leaf rollers.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.900
But this is in the oaks rutines.

19:33.320 --> 19:42.560
And oaks rutines tend to have more internal feeders than do the tortricines, the other, one of the other sub-famines.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.220
Okay.
