560	3500	All right, recording number two, December 18th.
3600	10140	There are other species of Japanulatrix, and I think, you know, most of them are Western,
10380	17140	and I think all of them, even the ones that are not in our area, feed on various species of Cyanothis.
18100	19680	I just got through you in a calculator.
20980	25520	And there are some that are coastal,
25520	31140	and some of the specimens that I collected looked like one of the coastal species,
31440	35480	and I dissected a few of them, and they turned out not to be that species.
36700	43420	And then there's a Sierra one that's fairly common, and some of our individuals look like that.
45660	52820	So I think most of them are recorded correctly, but it's a difficult genus,
52820	59300	and I know that it's impossible to say that mistakes haven't been made.
60320	62940	It would be an outright lie, I think.
67820	72320	Dysareocrania auriciania is an areocrania,
72460	76860	so one of the most primitive families of Lepidoptera.
77560	79420	They call them mandibulate moths.
79420	90340	They don't have functional mandibles, but they have non-functional remnants of mandibles as adults.
91340	92400	It feeds on oaks.
93660	94940	They come to light.
95360	99020	I've got this species one time in my backyard.
99020	106900	And when you have to be there at just the right time to get them.
106900	114520	So I think there's probably fairly uniform, but they do.
114940	122340	It is a leaf mining species, so it could be subject to crashes due to parasitism from time to time.
122340	127640	But if you're there at the right time, sometimes there's quite a few on the sheet.
128920	131580	Do you mean right time of year or right time of night?
131640	134260	Right time when the adults are active at the right time of year.
134320	140760	They fly early in the year, which could account for absence in some years of the data.
140760	147820	But at one time I was looking to get some because Bob Kinsey was anxious to get some.
148100	153540	And like many moths, once you try to get them, they go into hiding.
153540	168240	There's one other area, Crineid species, that's less common at Cold Canyon, and it didn't make the list.
169100	175720	And I decided to change its identification at some point during the survey.
176340	178160	I think I've only got it two or three times.
180820	182460	Dystroma emancipated.
182460	186100	Dystroma is a difficult genus.
187320	189860	And adults are variable.
190160	192260	This could be more than one species.
193460	201340	And the smallest ones, Ron Neuschner, who identified a number of moths for me,
203800	206860	called the smaller ones by a different name.
207000	211600	I think Covelli, just the same as the street here.
211600	221720	And I'm not sure whether those are just runts of emancipated or they are a different species.
221720	231780	And I think that to be certain about identification requires dissections.
231780	241480	But it's very common moth, although not in Davis, and highly variable.
241880	245340	And I don't know where one species ends and another one begins.
245340	254540	And I've just been calling them emancipated because that was the first name that was given to me for ones of average size.
254540	263960	The gyra, there's several species here.
264100	267380	These are all early moths, I believe.
268760	269540	Early in the year?
270160	271020	They're winter moths.
271280	273180	The adults are active in the winter.
273180	279820	And I believe all of them feed on trees and shrubs.
280820	283500	And I believe all of these are native species.
286280	288860	How do they feed on trees and shrubs?
289360	291200	Is it evergreen trees and shrubs?
291720	293800	I think they're just external feeders.
294040	296960	And they just, they don't make shelters or anything.
296960	300260	Oh, because the caterpillars are not out, the adults are out.
300340	300880	Okay, I understand.
301060	305740	I mean, they're noctuits, so they're grub-like worms.
308360	319500	And Crucialis, there's a species that some illustrations look similar to Crucialis.
319500	327620	But, and people who have gone to Cold Canyon have sent me records of that similar-looking species.
328460	334160	But I'm not convinced, you know, in all the years I went there, I never collected that species.
334520	342560	And I'm not convinced that those reports that were given to me are correctly identified specimens.
342560	356180	Curialis is similar to a moth in a different genus, but once you learn to tell them apart.
357260	361460	Okay, but I could have made some mistakes in the early years.
364460	367180	But, you know, there's two problems there.
367260	369100	One, if they're similar to other moths.
369100	373480	And two, if they're winter moths, they may be under-collected.
375340	377060	Hemolus is the most common one.
377360	383720	And I started recording it much more frequently in Davis than I did in the early years.
383960	391060	And I think this last year, or 23, it was more common than ever before.
391640	395100	So, I don't know, when you see patterns like that,
395100	400740	I don't know whether it means they've become established in my neighborhood or that it's a population cycle.
401180	404100	Or because it's a winter moth, I just didn't have records.
406900	410140	Perlubins is fairly easy to identify.
410140	421800	Mariah Robinson did that paper where she reared a lot of moths in the McLaughlin Reserve.
422340	431000	And if you can dig out that paper, there's probably some host plant records for at least the macro moths.
431000	438800	Do you, there's this period before 2000 where you didn't see this.
438880	444800	Do you think that's a true, like they weren't there, or?
445060	447260	Well, this is an easily recognized moth.
447420	456060	But I think it's possible, too, that this is a moth that's much more common on the upper trail.
456700	457000	Okay.
457000	460840	Generally, in the early months, there's two places that I collect.
462580	473200	In the earliest years, I collected almost exclusively right at that log-in site on the lower trail.
473640	477640	But then when I realized it was so damn cold there in the winter months,
477840	482540	I started just collecting at the gate right at the highway.
482540	492380	And there, collecting was much better because all the cold air that's settling in the lower parts of the canyon
492380	501500	are further up the trail or down the trail, depending on whether you say down south and up north,
502360	505060	out west and back east.
505060	518260	So, the early years may be not represented because I was collecting in that colder locality.
519420	526340	And then even in recent years, I collected either at the lower gate or just inside the gate on the west trail,
526340	530840	you know, which is where I collected any time I collected on the west trail,
531040	534000	except for once or twice I went further up the trail.
534000	542420	I mean, that's kind of a problem you have with the data from Cold Canyon.
542720	549500	It's collected all over the place and, you know, little things make a difference.
549900	552100	If I put the sheet this way, I get different things.
552160	554460	And if I put it that way, even in the same smoke.
554460	562140	So, you know, when you're trying to get as many different species as you can, that's not important.
562380	564380	You just don't care how you got them.
564420	565980	You just want to add them to the list.
569980	572280	Agyra rubrica, I got once in Davis,
572280	581060	and it was periodically encountered in reasonable numbers at Cold Canyon,
581180	583180	but it was not one of the more common species.
583180	586560	And then there was one or two that I got only once or twice.
587880	591160	And I think those species tended to be more coastal,
591620	594340	and they occasionally spill over.
594760	597140	There's one called Febriolus, which is not here.
598040	602700	And that one, some years, it seemed to me, was in reasonable numbers.
603700	609380	The problem is, you know, if I only go there once during every half-month period,
609380	616040	it's not the same as going there ten times during that half-month period in a year when they're flying.
616040	625920	And that kind of gives you an erroneous indication of how common the species is.
631600	635100	Eidophasia vanilla used to be, it's in Plutality.
635960	641240	It used to be Plutella vanilla, which is much more fun to say than Eidophasia vanilla.
641240	646580	And its food plant is known, and it's in the literature.
647120	658380	I got this once in Davis, and it's a very distinct moth, brown and white,
658380	662140	kind of a harlequin pattern.
662380	665780	It's, you can't confuse it with anything else.
667260	672200	But it was always, it's one of these, it's kind of pleasing to see,
672300	676580	because it has a more colorful than a little brown or a little gray moth.
677220	680640	So I would tend to collect them when they did come to life,
680740	683900	and record them, and identify them correctly.
683900	691920	Amylina monodactyla is the pterophorid that feeds on Morning Glory
691920	696220	and that family of plants.
696780	702520	It's a variable moth, and I think it's a monotypic genus.
702520	712220	And I found an old key on that subfamily of pterophorids,
712460	719900	and it gave a character, an external character on the legs as diagnostic,
720400	722880	like a tuft of scales or something like that.
723060	724680	I'd have to look to see what it was.
724680	734540	But the moth itself varies from kind of a dingy white to a soft brown.
736840	742460	But once you get a feeling on it, but it could be confused with other species
742460	748620	and some of the other related pterophorid genera.
748620	753760	They're a place throughout the year.
754060	759340	And as I said before, it seems that pterophorids are not strongly attracted to light.
760780	769360	And so that is something that suggests that what you're saying here is what comes to light,
769420	773000	and it may underrepresent species that don't come to light.
773000	776540	That's why there's not many butterflies, and diurnal moth.
779060	782000	Endothenia hebezena is...
782000	792000	I think this is a...
792000	796660	Maybe it's an Olethrutine tortricid.
797960	802320	And I'm on the danger of confusing it with another species.
802320	804860	I think this is the one that's on paintbrush.
806340	810480	And I've reared it a number of times.
816300	820600	When I come to the other species, I'll look this up when I get...
820600	820780	Okay.
821040	823920	Look at your notes and make sure that I'm doing it right.
824180	826980	So I'm going to just quit at this point in discussing something.
826980	834220	Can you resume telling us which ones you know about, if they're native or non-native, or if you're unsure?
834820	835100	Yeah.
835220	837380	Because you're telling us sometimes, and I forgot to ask you.
837380	840080	Let me do it this way.
840080	849840	By default, I will point out non-native species if I know that they're non-native.
850100	850280	Okay.
851080	854420	But, you know, just the other day I was cleaning up some of the clutter in my house,
854420	862700	and I found a reprint of a paper that Jerry Powell wrote on Bactra.
862900	865540	Remember, that was the Torturism that Feeds on Reeds.
866540	868320	And the title of the paper was,
869280	873220	New Species of Bactra, One Possibly Non-Native.
873220	877260	So he speculated that one of those species was non-native.
877540	879820	It was not any of the ones that we collected.
881080	885900	There was another interesting story about one of those species, but I won't talk about it now.
889380	892320	Ephesia cuneiello, I discussed at Davis.
892800	893040	Okay.
893460	894140	We can skip it.
894780	901260	It declined greatly in numbers in Davis in recent years, and I don't know why that is.
901260	907680	It's either, but it could be, you know, these are physitines, and they're all similar to one another.
908540	918920	And I may have misidentified some as this species in the beginning and then learned that they were something else,
919120	922860	but that's speculation.
925920	929160	All these surveys were a learn-it-should-go type of thing for me.
929160	939320	So, Ephesiodes erythrella is not the false raisin moth, as you wrote down here,
939400	943100	but it's in the same genus as the false raisin moth.
945040	945420	Okay.
945900	948720	The false raisin moth is the next one, Gilda Centella.
948720	948960	Okay.
949960	956300	And erythrella is a darker moth with some brick red coloration on it.
956300	967220	And it shows up in modest numbers some years and not at all in other years.
967640	969160	So I think this is real.
969940	978080	It's one that, once I realized that the ones that had this brick red coloration and were darker would not Gilda Centella,
978080	983240	I was able to record accurately from then on.
983560	990940	And I determined that fairly early in the survey, and I did some dissections and made slides,
991020	998820	which you need to do to see the subtle differences in genitalia and confirm that we have both species.
998820	1010820	But Gilda Centella is the most common moth in Davis and one of the most common small moths at Coltenham as well.
1010820	1022820	This is one, I think I told you this story before, that sometimes I've had individuals in my relaxer
1022820	1027940	where I put things before I spread them, and they lay eggs even though they're dead.
1027940	1029140	Dead? That's crazy.
1029260	1032260	And then those caterpillars get out and eat the other moths.
1032260	1042200	So I think these species of erythrella are kind of scavengers and opportunistic feeders.
1043200	1046600	Detritus scavengers, stored product foods.
1047420	1057760	So occasional pests, but they're not as serious as things like Indian meal moth and the other pantry moths.
1057760	1060320	There's Epinodia emarginana.
1062640	1065400	There's several species of epinodia here.
1066040	1067600	Emarginana feeds on oaks.
1068440	1077020	And it's recognizable because the edges of the wigs, extreme edge of the wigs,
1078100	1082100	the apical edge of the wigs, have an indentation.
1082360	1083280	They're emarginate.
1084340	1086020	That's where the name comes from.
1086020	1094520	But there's another species on mountain mahogany, Cercocarpus, that also has that notch.
1096020	1105580	And Cercocarpus is kind of up on, mostly up on the west-facing slope.
1105580	1112020	So, I did collect some larvae on Cercocarpus and reared them.
1112140	1118660	But the problem is, sometimes they spin down from oaks and pupate on other things.
1119080	1123980	But Powell confirmed that I do have the species from Cercocarpus as well.
1124340	1127820	I think it's Cercocarpana, strangely enough.
1127820	1138880	And marginana is, it seems to emerge in late spring, early summer.
1139120	1142200	That's when you get really fresh-looking individuals.
1142200	1148400	But you get adults year-round, including, you know, I found them in my house on New Year's Day one time.
1148760	1149120	You know what?
1149120	1160320	So, they overwinter as adults and then lay their eggs in just before the new flush of leaves on live oaks, especially.
1160320	1163640	Are they, um, miners?
1164320	1164680	Pardon me?
1164740	1165420	Are they miners?
1165500	1166380	No, they're leaf.
1166960	1167640	Tortrissas.
1167900	1168360	Leaf rollers.
1169160	1171060	Most tortrissas are leaf rollers.
1171240	1172900	But this is in the oaks rutines.
1173320	1182560	And oaks rutines tend to have more internal feeders than do the tortricines, the other, one of the other sub-famines.
1182880	1183220	Okay.
