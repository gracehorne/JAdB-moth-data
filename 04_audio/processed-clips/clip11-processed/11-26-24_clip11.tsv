0	5300	time to time. Spodoptera, see, Spodoptera was still the most common
5300	8620	to a metrida by yard this year, but it was down in numbers.
8940	11120	Do you think that it's native?
16920	19000	But again, that's...
21740	28000	Pyralis farinalis is a stored...
28000	37860	It's the grain moth, the egg grain moth, or something like that. Farina. Farina is what, some kind of boiled wheat product or something.
38140	39560	A porridge type thing.
39680	47840	It's a cereal anyway. So I think this feeds on cereals, and it has quite a range of sizes,
49840	56460	and I've never seen it in my house, and I guess people have found it infesting stored grains,
56460	65320	but maybe mostly sile, and silage or something, but it shows up in my yard at almost any time of the year, and
66320	69020	never in great numbers.
69020	81260	And I thought it'd been kind of consistently inconsistent, but you show that your model suggests that it's declining, which could be true.
81260	91840	You know, a lot of these stored products bests may exploit compost, too.
91980	102900	So if people are composting, that's a possibility, I'll say, augmenting their population.
102900	104340	Oh, that one, yeah.
104340	111760	Pyrasta californicalis feeds on various mints and flies both during the day and at night.
111760	126740	So this is a tiny moth with bright yellow-orange hindwings, and you'll often see it, say, around rosemary during the day.
127060	130280	Or if you have any blooming mint plant during the day, you'll see.
130280	144000	So I thought that maybe what we were saying is, if I turn the light on early, ones that were active during the day, when it gets dark, go to the light.
144460	151980	But it's clear that some of them are flying well after sunset.
151980	160100	So I think it's just one of these species that's both diurnally and nocturnally active.
162380	163140	Pyrasta lataclavia.
163500	166520	Powell told me that this is an introduced species.
167800	170540	So I don't know that I ever got it at Cold Cannon.
170920	173980	And it has two very different forms.
174140	180220	One is very attractive, yellow and red.
180220	188500	And the other one is kind of a muddy, chestnut color with some marked markings.
189080	192800	And I think they're seasonal, but I'm not certain.
193100	201820	And the one that's kind of muddy looking is very similar to a moth that is very common at Cold Cannon.
201980	203100	Pyrasta.
204080	204560	Moran Alice?
205080	206400	Moran Alice, yeah.
206400	216380	And I've recorded Moran Alice from my yard now, but I'm not 100% certain that my identifications of these are correct.
216380	230160	And these were treated in one of the first Moth of North America monographs, but the photographs and the descriptive material are not.
231460	233440	So do you think this is really showing up here?
233980	236820	Oh, this is lataclavia we're talking about now.
237680	238060	Oh, okay.
238060	238520	Got it.
238580	242480	But Volupialis is also an introduced species.
243760	249800	And the thinking is that these are being spread around on nursery stock.
249800	261060	And, you know, one of the places I like to buy plants from is, what do they call it, Morning Sun Herb Farm.
261780	262560	Do you know the place?
263240	268220	It's down on, what's the road?
268460	272460	The road that comes out at Solano Park, Pleasance Valley Road.
273280	274160	I don't know this place.
274320	275340	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
275340	276020	Yeah, okay.
276920	281060	So there's that park, you know, where people.
282700	290280	I went there to buy plants and, you know, she says, well, what are the moths eating our mints?
290280	295580	Because originally they were an herb farm, you know, they sold herbs.
296080	300540	They also grow ornamentals, mostly jolt-oled plants.
300540	303840	So I said, well, there's a number of them.
304760	307700	And I made her a little kit to show what they look like.
310520	317480	This one, once it showed up, I seem to be getting it fairly regularly.
317480	328340	So whether it came to my yard on some herb that I had brought in from an outdoor nursery room, I can't say.
331200	335500	But eventually it did show up at Cold Canyon.
335660	340900	And I think I have one or two records from Cold Canyon, but not enough for analysis, apparently.
340900	358600	There is a similar looking species at, a native species at Cold Canyon called Grotei, G-R-O-T-E-I.
359540	360680	He's probably on there.
360680	365240	I think the story went to some neighbor or friend of hers who said, why don't you call your daughter?
365560	366860	How else did Grotei is?
367040	368920	Maybe you don't have nothing.
370060	372280	And that eventually showed up in my yard.
372700	373420	Call my son.
373640	379140	Palupialis, and it's red with pale markings, just the same as Palupialis.
379660	381360	But the pattern is different.
382320	385180	That, you know, a casual look, you'll confuse one with the other.
385180	391020	So, are we at Spodoptera now?
391300	391460	Yes.
392840	401760	Spodoptera, Exigula, beet army worm, among another of hosts of common names.
402940	407100	And I didn't realize it, but it is an introduced species.
407400	408540	Well, at least you realized it.
408540	413580	Which may explain why it doesn't look like any of the other Spodoptera.
418140	430520	And it is by far the most common geometric in my yard, and is also very common at Cold Canyon.
430960	434560	But whether it's the most common one there or not, I'd have to check the numbers.
434560	444900	And there were some nights when I ran the light trap in the early years.
445160	451080	And there were so many Spodoptera, I said, I don't want to count them.
452220	458240	And sometimes when there's a lot of them at my light, I've made an estimate of how many are there.
458940	460240	A conservative estimate.
460240	469060	So, I record the number that I collect plus an estimate of the number that I didn't collect, which is usually around.
470100	471420	I didn't know you were collecting that.
471720	476220	I knew you were collecting the number that you collected, but not the estimated amount that you didn't collect.
476220	485580	But I only do that if I want to be more representative of how many actually showed up.
489340	491040	I mean, you have to make some decisions.
491540	492540	We can't do everything.
492680	492860	Yeah.
493180	493360	Yeah.
493360	499960	So, I don't know whether I was making those estimates in the beginning or not.
501420	503980	But this shows a decline.
504520	510480	You would think if I wasn't doing that in the beginning, it would show an even greater decline.
511000	511520	Yeah.
512320	514340	It might show a false increase.
514340	525420	Spadoptera prefica, there's another species which looks almost exactly like it, called Orthogalli.
529800	536380	And there are reports of Orthogalli from around here, but I've been looking over these carefully.
536380	548160	And based on the character that I saw in the literature, I've never seen Orthogalli in my yard.
548720	554640	But there's a possibility that we do have Orthogalli and that it does show up.
554880	555880	This is an armyworm.
555980	559520	I think it's called yellow-striped armyworm or something like that.
559520	573040	And Greg's father owned a ranch in Knight's Landing, and he reported one year that these things were just all over the place.
573320	582200	So, this is something that is subject to outbreaks and then probably gets knocked down again, either by disease or parasitism.
585260	589340	And Wagner's been after me for the longest time to send him one for eggs.
589520	590860	So, that he can raise the larva.
591680	598920	And ever since I've looked for it, I've never gotten a female or never got a female that laid eggs.
599260	600200	Do you think it's native?
601280	602180	I think so.
602600	604860	He wants it desperately for his book.
604940	606280	For his book, so he can take pictures.
606280	607100	Yeah, his caterpillar book.
607100	608620	Well, if it's the softest...
608620	611020	I can't remember whether it was before I actually...
611020	612880	Stigmella, species number three.
614660	616280	Could be more than one species.
616280	622680	And then there's another one that may be just smaller individuals of species number three.
623020	625640	So, I've called all the ones that are kind of like me.
625980	630060	The one that's very distinct is Stigmella, species number two.
630940	637220	And this is irrelevant because what I called one, two, and three in Davis are not the same as one, two, and three.
637320	638880	Well, one, two, and three are not here.
639240	639500	Yeah.
639500	641280	Like, at all.
641460	643820	So, maybe they just are not abundant enough?
644180	645500	Probably not enough of them.
645540	647480	So, is that a more urban species?
647660	649720	Because we get those on Quercus lobata all the time.
649880	651760	It's a Deptocula and it's a Leafbinder.
651820	652020	Yeah.
652520	655180	And so, Leafbinders are very host-specific.
656240	662620	And it could be an urban species or it could be one that I just don't collect very often.
662620	667460	Because they're on the Quercus lobata, which is in Cold Canyon.
668280	672660	Well, I don't know what this one feeds up on.
675100	675660	Stigmella.
676500	681360	So, they might actually be, like, species-specific, like, host-specific by species and not genus?
681360	691940	Well, other leaf-mining species sometimes are specific at the oak species level.
691940	698920	And others are specialists on Quercus or in closely related.
699220	704140	So, if they feed an agrifolia, they'll also get on whyslazenia, you know, the hard leaf.
705660	709280	But I don't know if this feeds on oak or anything else in my yard.
709280	712200	I've not looked for mines on anything.
712400	714460	It just shows up for some reason.
714960	719680	And over the years, I've learned where it tends to land on my light sheet.
720500	721840	Whoa, like how close to the light?
721840	728180	So, it tends to be at the very top of the sheet and in the center where the light is.
728480	732220	So, I think they land on the sheet and then skitter up to the top of the sheet.
733180	737160	And a great number of the tiny moths do the same thing.
737160	739900	So, this is what I call a minute moth.
740020	743740	So, this is too small for most people to spread.
744260	746580	You know, it's like the size of a...
746580	751000	...aumatidia in an average-sized moth.
751160	752400	They're very, very small.
752400	761240	And many of them, I have to use the smallest size minutons available in order to pin them.
761740	765300	And then, if you try to spin them, spread them, it's just dumb luck.
765820	767700	You know, either they spread or they don't.
768240	769680	More often than not, they don't.
769860	770900	So, I just pin them up.
770900	772960	You know, I guess if...
772960	779840	Like I said, most of these leaf miners have been identified by being collected as larvae.
780240	786640	But there is a monograph on Stigmella that was done by some guy in...
786640	789460	If you could offer me that job, I wouldn't have taken it because it's just...
789460	791180	One of the Scandinavian countries.
791200	792320	Well, it just looked boring.
792380	793720	Wilkinson, his name was.
793980	794280	It's super boring.
794360	795060	It's available.
795420	796380	I mean, you know.
796720	797880	And then...
797880	799800	Not that some of the stuff that I have done is...
799800	805940	Don Davis at the Smithsonian prepared a Mona monograph on it, but it never got published.
805940	814560	And I think for the reason that they figure nobody gives a rat's ass about my new moth that they can't see or spread.
814620	815440	But you still get the...
815440	816360	I get rats ass.
816380	821000	They don't want to go to the expense of publishing a book that only libraries and...
821000	822640	Well, it's one of the reasons I've been kind of mad.
822660	823800	Crazy people like me.
824560	828460	...letting me label his Arizona bees that have code numbers.
828740	833880	But, you know, back when I was in graduate school, first in graduate school, so that was...
833880	835380	Well, he keeps saying that's a good idea, but it never happened.
836940	844080	So around almost 50, 45 years ago now, Don Davis showed me the pictures that he had.
844300	846140	You know, they all were hand-drawn.
846480	847880	They didn't use photography.
848200	849220	They're beautiful pictures.
849560	851520	He says, this is ready for publication.
851920	854240	45 years later, it still hasn't been published.
854880	859180	And I hear Don Davis is not in good health, so it probably will never publish.
859180	861320	He said that he told him that...
861320	868040	Samoka Signatella is in the same family that Otto's stickity with Egoconia that we discussed
868040	868400	early.
868400	879300	And this one, unlike Egoconia, shows up with some regularity at Cold Canyon, as well as in my yard.
879300	889260	And I don't know anything about Egoconia, nor do I know whether it's stated or not.
889940	893460	But that's a very small family.
893460	902920	And before it had been, it and Egoconia had been bounced around among a number of different
902920	906460	families, including, I think, Lester Basis.
906460	910460	Let me stop this and take a quick...
