1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,500
But we also have more from Cold Canyon.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,500
Cold Canyon is...

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,220
But we'll get together another day for this.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,220
Pandora's box.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,880
Okay, very good.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,020
Syncora errata is one of those green geometries.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,960
I love those.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,300
Somewhat of a generalist.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,640
And maybe more than one species involved under that name.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,920
Wagner is kind of working on green geometries.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,920
And he keeps telling me that certain species are...

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,460
DNA evidence suggests there's more than one species.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,840
So that's part of the reason why I used the specific name here.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,600
I don't know whether...

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,920
You know, I didn't update all the names at Cold Canyon yet.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,380
It looks like that's updated.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,060
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Well, I think...

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,060
I've been to Panama and it's hot when it's hot.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,920
Yeah, I linked them.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
Grace updated the names.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:05,980
Yeah.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,120
But I worked up.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,500
Tacoma Ferriela is a place of time.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,500
Feeds on mistletoe.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Because it's just...

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,060
I'm pretty adventurous, but I don't go meet strangers in the cemeteries.

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,880
You know, my willow tree had a lot of mistletoe in it.

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,280
And that may be why it's declining, but, you know, because I took the mistletoe out.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,620
But it turns out there's mistletoe in a lot of the other trees in my yard and in my neighborhood as well.

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,920
That's funny.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
Easy to identify.

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,500
So this is one of those spisotines.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,260
It's unlike any other.

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,960
So everyone is recorded and everyone is correctly identified.

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,580
Unless it's more than one species.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,240
Yeah.

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,260
They're kind of large.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,480
They're very good for children.

40
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah.

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,540
Telfuza sigulatella is a kalechid that feeds on oaks.

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,240
And I know in the Bay Area it's on coastal live oak.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,920
And I don't know whether it feeds on all oaks or just live oaks.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,600
Because I have a cheap set, too, that don't look like pipes.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,760
But they were $29,000.

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,140
You collect oaks, you put it in a bag, and you get Telfuza.

47
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,180
And the adults are long-lived.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:50,920
So I think what happens is they emerge in the late spring, maybe mid spring, and then are present as adults and lay eggs the following year so that the caterpillars can feed on the unhardened out leaves of oaks before the tannins build up.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,540
I think that's the strategy of a lot of things that feed on oaks.

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,920
Terenolata polygera is in a...

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
This is in the primitive...

52
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,920
What used to be...

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Now it's in Erebiti.

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,180
Or Erebiti, I'm not sure.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,480
So this is one of the more primitive of the noctuoid.

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,920
What used to be noctuos, has really weird forelegs.

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,220
And I didn't realize, and I looked at it under the scope one, and I go, whoa.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
And Wagner says that it's...

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
Please find leaf litter.

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,600
You're okay, baby. Come on.

61
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,980
Leaf litter.

62
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,640
Our father couldn't understand the matter.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,160
Exactly.

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,320
But, uh...

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,980
So...

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,360
If anybody knows, he does.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,980
And, um...

68
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,180
It shows up fairly regularly over a long period of time in my yard.

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,960
And I see it less frequently at Cold Canyon.

70
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,920
I don't know whether it made the analysis or not.

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,760
It does.

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:12,760
But it's more common in my backyard, but, you know, all of the leaf litter blows into the corner of my patio, over which I hang my sheet, so...

73
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
So, it's a little...

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,120
This was for the...

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,980
It's a little...

76
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,440
You don't know if people are wearing it.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,700
And, you know, it's actually pretty stiff.

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,200
Yeah.

79
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,980
It means they're wearing...

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,220
Chicapluzia me is the alfalfa looper, I think.

81
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,100
It's a semi-looper.

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
It's not a looper.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,640
True loopers are geometrious.

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,520
Semi-loopers are a Rebidae that...

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,500
Whose larvae don't have the full volume of prolegs.

86
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,080
And so they move like an inchworm.

87
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,960
But they have more prolegs than do geometries.

88
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,580
I was curious about that.

89
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,060
Because this is a pest, too.

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,360
Because I think I grew basil, and it was on my basil.

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:10,840
Well, I think it's notorious for being on, I think, a lot of forage crops.

92
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,740
So, my brother lived in New Mexico for a while, and he said one year that they were everywhere.

93
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:30,160
And yet, around where he lived, they grew hay or something that, you know, was baled and turned it to hay.

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:38,920
So, I suspect it's somewhat of a generalist, but I can't say.

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:50,540
And Greg seems to get it more frequently in his yard than I do in mine, but I don't know if that's real or not.

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,300
Trichopolia alfkeniae.

97
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
I don't...

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:08,300
There is a monograph on the old genus in which it was replaced, and I might be able to find information about what it feeds on, but I have no idea.

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,760
I think it's native and probably a generalist.

100
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:23,920
And it's in the family of noctuas that have hairy eyes, and some of the literature says it has hairy eyes, but when I look under the scope, it doesn't seem to have hairy eyes.

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,780
Nor does the other species, ruffula, which is in the genus.

102
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:38,100
But I've done the dissections, and the genitalia are correct for these two species of what is now trichopolia.

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:49,320
And this genus was coined since the new checklist.

104
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,920
So, this name came off of Moth Photographers Group.

105
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,240
Wow. Brand new.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,820
Eudea profondalis.

107
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,240
I think this one...

108
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:12,120
I looked it up when I made that display for Moth Night, but I don't remember what it feeds on.

109
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:29,800
I think this is one that more commonly flies during the day than at night, because, you know, kicking around the yard, I can often kick one up.

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:39,820
So, there could be circumstances under which you get more at night than you do in other rooms.

111
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,340
It looks like it's declining in Davis and Cold Canyon.

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
Do you think that could be correct?

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,860
Showing decline.

114
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,620
Eudea profondalis.

115
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:55,520
Now, there are similar-looking profondalis, and I got this name from Powell.

116
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,620
And when I did look on the paper on Eudea, this seemed to be the correct name for it.

117
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:11,580
But there's a possibility that we have similar species around here which would have been erroneously recorded as profondalis.

118
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:27,860
I'm not about making mistakes, and the people who say they never make mistakes are fooling themselves, or they're Donald Trump.

119
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,680
Last one?

120
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,740
That's the last one.

121
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,520
Zeno Leckia, Querciphaia.

122
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,200
Actually, I can't play that thing with my hearing.

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,140
Fuson Oaks, as the name implies.

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:52,960
It flies late in the year, and Opler had a name for another species, and I thought I knew how to tell them apart.

125
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:02,840
Opler did that Oaks' Island paper, you know, which is semi-famous, I guess, among, well-known to ecologists, anyway.

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,400
But I don't think the species was ever described.

127
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,080
It may have been Staspha, I think, as the other species.

128
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:21,420
And I thought I knew how to record them, but now I'm recording everything as Querciphaia or other species, because I'm not certain that.

129
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,680
You know, that's the danger.

130
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:35,460
When you think you know that this is a diagnostic character, once you start sorting them out, using that as a character.

131
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:41,380
I learned that lesson, you know, when I took systematic entomology at Berkeley.

132
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,760
I got a box of bees, and then I started sorting them out.

133
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:54,380
I sorted out these because they had more antenatal segments than these, but males have more antenatal segments than females.

134
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,140
So, it was a rookie mistake.

135
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,580
I bet you never made that mistake again.

136
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,400
Well, I learned that that was a sex-linked character.

137
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:22,260
There are many secondary sex-linked characters on Lepidopter that make it easy to identify one sex, but can't tell the other sex.

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Wow, we're done.

139
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
Okay, we got through Davis.

140
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
That's crazy.

141
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,740
Congratulations.

142
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:42,440
Before you came, I was talking to Grace about how I got to the names that I'm using.

143
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,060
But the final thing that I have to say is it's an iterative process.

144
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,840
I revisit things over and over and over again.

145
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,360
And sometimes it takes me years to get a name.

146
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,060
And I thought, you know, like I told you about that Ectomyelois serotoninae.

147
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
What was the person talking about?

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
It was just a picture.

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,960
I finally got the name because I saw a paper on that genus in China.

150
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,040
And I said, well, that looks like my moth.

151
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,940
And, you know, it turned out it was in the U.S.

152
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,080
And there was another one that was similar.

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:26,780
It was a moth that Art had discovered the larva and reared some out.

154
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,420
And nobody could identify it.

155
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,780
Greg had a specimen from his yard, and I caught it.

156
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,040
Turned out we got quite a few for a while, but nobody was able to get a name on it.

157
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,540
We speculated on the genus and so forth.

158
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,420
But it didn't quite fit.

159
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:50,100
And then there was a paper in the newsletter about this European moth had been collected in Idaho and Montana, I think, maybe Wyoming.

160
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,380
And it was our moth.

161
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,360
And it fed on prickly lettuce, which was what Art found the larvae on.

162
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,720
You know, I wrote the author.

163
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
I said, this is California.

164
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,740
He said, well, since I wrote that, now it's known to be throughout the Northwest and California.

165
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,920
Wow, spreads fast.

166
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:19,760
You just, you have to be able to implant the image of what something looks like in your head and put the pieces together.

167
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,980
Well, I think the fact that you need to go back and ID things and update things and how intricate it is is why other people don't do this.

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,440
Well, they don't do it because most of the specimens go to a museum or something.

169
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,200
You know, you have to have a manageable number of specimens to revisit and a manageable number of species.

170
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:52,060
So, to me, the biggest waste of time is to go to New Guinea or something and collect, you know, a thousand different species of moths.

171
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,280
That'll never be, you know, only the big flashy ones will ever be identified.

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:03,480
Unless a specialist visits your collection and picks out things that are of interest.

173
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,880
Thanks, guys.

174
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,260
Thanks, guys.

175
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
Thanks.

176
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,660
Thanks.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,420
Yeah.
