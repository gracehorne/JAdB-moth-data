80	2500	But we also have more from Cold Canyon.
2880	4500	Cold Canyon is...
4500	6220	But we'll get together another day for this.
6340	7220	Pandora's box.
9640	10880	Okay, very good.
11160	14020	Syncora errata is one of those green geometries.
14300	14960	I love those.
15860	17300	Somewhat of a generalist.
18280	24640	And maybe more than one species involved under that name.
25140	27920	Wagner is kind of working on green geometries.
27920	33920	And he keeps telling me that certain species are...
34980	38460	DNA evidence suggests there's more than one species.
38960	43840	So that's part of the reason why I used the specific name here.
46040	47600	I don't know whether...
47600	52920	You know, I didn't update all the names at Cold Canyon yet.
53260	54380	It looks like that's updated.
54760	55060	Yeah.
57920	59920	Well, I think...
59920	63060	I've been to Panama and it's hot when it's hot.
63380	63920	Yeah, I linked them.
63920	65480	Grace updated the names.
65840	65980	Yeah.
67200	68120	But I worked up.
69080	71500	Tacoma Ferriela is a place of time.
71600	72500	Feeds on mistletoe.
72920	73920	Because it's just...
73920	81060	I'm pretty adventurous, but I don't go meet strangers in the cemeteries.
81060	83880	You know, my willow tree had a lot of mistletoe in it.
85120	89280	And that may be why it's declining, but, you know, because I took the mistletoe out.
89280	94620	But it turns out there's mistletoe in a lot of the other trees in my yard and in my neighborhood as well.
94940	95920	That's funny.
96440	97640	Easy to identify.
97820	99500	So this is one of those spisotines.
99800	101260	It's unlike any other.
101260	105960	So everyone is recorded and everyone is correctly identified.
106960	110580	Unless it's more than one species.
111080	111240	Yeah.
111380	112260	They're kind of large.
113140	114480	They're very good for children.
115020	115300	Yeah.
116260	123540	Telfuza sigulatella is a kalechid that feeds on oaks.
123540	130240	And I know in the Bay Area it's on coastal live oak.
130360	134920	And I don't know whether it feeds on all oaks or just live oaks.
134920	138600	Because I have a cheap set, too, that don't look like pipes.
138960	139760	But they were $29,000.
139760	143140	You collect oaks, you put it in a bag, and you get Telfuza.
143860	146180	And the adults are long-lived.
146180	170920	So I think what happens is they emerge in the late spring, maybe mid spring, and then are present as adults and lay eggs the following year so that the caterpillars can feed on the unhardened out leaves of oaks before the tannins build up.
170920	177540	I think that's the strategy of a lot of things that feed on oaks.
180540	183920	Terenolata polygera is in a...
183920	186920	This is in the primitive...
187740	188920	What used to be...
188920	190920	Now it's in Erebiti.
191500	193180	Or Erebiti, I'm not sure.
194440	198480	So this is one of the more primitive of the noctuoid.
198480	204920	What used to be noctuos, has really weird forelegs.
204920	211220	And I didn't realize, and I looked at it under the scope one, and I go, whoa.
212960	214480	And Wagner says that it's...
215680	216720	Please find leaf litter.
217300	218600	You're okay, baby. Come on.
219100	219980	Leaf litter.
219980	221640	Our father couldn't understand the matter.
221640	222160	Exactly.
222640	224320	But, uh...
224320	224980	So...
224980	227360	If anybody knows, he does.
229360	229980	And, um...
230540	235180	It shows up fairly regularly over a long period of time in my yard.
235540	238960	And I see it less frequently at Cold Canyon.
239100	241920	I don't know whether it made the analysis or not.
242320	242760	It does.
242760	252760	But it's more common in my backyard, but, you know, all of the leaf litter blows into the corner of my patio, over which I hang my sheet, so...
252760	254760	So, it's a little...
254760	255120	This was for the...
255120	255980	It's a little...
255980	257440	You don't know if people are wearing it.
257440	259700	And, you know, it's actually pretty stiff.
259700	260200	Yeah.
260200	260980	It means they're wearing...
260980	267220	Chicapluzia me is the alfalfa looper, I think.
267280	268100	It's a semi-looper.
268100	270100	It's not a looper.
270160	271640	True loopers are geometrious.
271740	276520	Semi-loopers are a Rebidae that...
276520	282500	Whose larvae don't have the full volume of prolegs.
283780	286080	And so they move like an inchworm.
286660	291960	But they have more prolegs than do geometries.
292220	293580	I was curious about that.
293780	295060	Because this is a pest, too.
295420	298360	Because I think I grew basil, and it was on my basil.
298360	310840	Well, I think it's notorious for being on, I think, a lot of forage crops.
312940	319740	So, my brother lived in New Mexico for a while, and he said one year that they were everywhere.
319740	330160	And yet, around where he lived, they grew hay or something that, you know, was baled and turned it to hay.
330380	338920	So, I suspect it's somewhat of a generalist, but I can't say.
338920	350540	And Greg seems to get it more frequently in his yard than I do in mine, but I don't know if that's real or not.
353700	355300	Trichopolia alfkeniae.
355300	356140	I don't...
356140	368300	There is a monograph on the old genus in which it was replaced, and I might be able to find information about what it feeds on, but I have no idea.
368920	372760	I think it's native and probably a generalist.
374880	383920	And it's in the family of noctuas that have hairy eyes, and some of the literature says it has hairy eyes, but when I look under the scope, it doesn't seem to have hairy eyes.
384160	387780	Nor does the other species, ruffula, which is in the genus.
389060	398100	But I've done the dissections, and the genitalia are correct for these two species of what is now trichopolia.
398920	409320	And this genus was coined since the new checklist.
409900	412920	So, this name came off of Moth Photographers Group.
414860	416240	Wow. Brand new.
416240	418820	Eudea profondalis.
422580	424240	I think this one...
424240	432120	I looked it up when I made that display for Moth Night, but I don't remember what it feeds on.
432120	449800	I think this is one that more commonly flies during the day than at night, because, you know, kicking around the yard, I can often kick one up.
449800	459820	So, there could be circumstances under which you get more at night than you do in other rooms.
460480	463340	It looks like it's declining in Davis and Cold Canyon.
463600	464700	Do you think that could be correct?
464920	465860	Showing decline.
466860	468620	Eudea profondalis.
468620	475520	Now, there are similar-looking profondalis, and I got this name from Powell.
476140	482620	And when I did look on the paper on Eudea, this seemed to be the correct name for it.
483240	491580	But there's a possibility that we have similar species around here which would have been erroneously recorded as profondalis.
491580	507860	I'm not about making mistakes, and the people who say they never make mistakes are fooling themselves, or they're Donald Trump.
511880	512680	Last one?
512940	513740	That's the last one.
514240	516520	Zeno Leckia, Querciphaia.
516520	518200	Actually, I can't play that thing with my hearing.
518200	521140	Fuson Oaks, as the name implies.
521580	532960	It flies late in the year, and Opler had a name for another species, and I thought I knew how to tell them apart.
533060	542840	Opler did that Oaks' Island paper, you know, which is semi-famous, I guess, among, well-known to ecologists, anyway.
543760	546400	But I don't think the species was ever described.
546400	552080	It may have been Staspha, I think, as the other species.
552740	561420	And I thought I knew how to record them, but now I'm recording everything as Querciphaia or other species, because I'm not certain that.
561420	564680	You know, that's the danger.
564800	575460	When you think you know that this is a diagnostic character, once you start sorting them out, using that as a character.
575460	581380	I learned that lesson, you know, when I took systematic entomology at Berkeley.
581820	584760	I got a box of bees, and then I started sorting them out.
585040	594380	I sorted out these because they had more antenatal segments than these, but males have more antenatal segments than females.
594380	598140	So, it was a rookie mistake.
599160	600580	I bet you never made that mistake again.
601340	606400	Well, I learned that that was a sex-linked character.
606400	622260	There are many secondary sex-linked characters on Lepidopter that make it easy to identify one sex, but can't tell the other sex.
624480	625920	Wow, we're done.
625920	627040	Okay, we got through Davis.
627040	628000	That's crazy.
629060	629740	Congratulations.
629740	642440	Before you came, I was talking to Grace about how I got to the names that I'm using.
643300	648060	But the final thing that I have to say is it's an iterative process.
648480	651840	I revisit things over and over and over again.
652760	656360	And sometimes it takes me years to get a name.
656360	660060	And I thought, you know, like I told you about that Ectomyelois serotoninae.
660080	661200	What was the person talking about?
661200	662200	It was just a picture.
662280	668960	I finally got the name because I saw a paper on that genus in China.
669220	671040	And I said, well, that looks like my moth.
671300	672940	And, you know, it turned out it was in the U.S.
672940	677080	And there was another one that was similar.
677080	686780	It was a moth that Art had discovered the larva and reared some out.
686940	688420	And nobody could identify it.
688760	691780	Greg had a specimen from his yard, and I caught it.
692140	696040	Turned out we got quite a few for a while, but nobody was able to get a name on it.
696300	698540	We speculated on the genus and so forth.
698720	700420	But it didn't quite fit.
700420	710100	And then there was a paper in the newsletter about this European moth had been collected in Idaho and Montana, I think, maybe Wyoming.
711100	712380	And it was our moth.
712840	717360	And it fed on prickly lettuce, which was what Art found the larvae on.
717620	719720	You know, I wrote the author.
719880	720800	I said, this is California.
720980	726740	He said, well, since I wrote that, now it's known to be throughout the Northwest and California.
727740	728920	Wow, spreads fast.
728920	739760	You just, you have to be able to implant the image of what something looks like in your head and put the pieces together.
741220	748980	Well, I think the fact that you need to go back and ID things and update things and how intricate it is is why other people don't do this.
750140	754440	Well, they don't do it because most of the specimens go to a museum or something.
754440	762200	You know, you have to have a manageable number of specimens to revisit and a manageable number of species.
762900	772060	So, to me, the biggest waste of time is to go to New Guinea or something and collect, you know, a thousand different species of moths.
772160	776280	That'll never be, you know, only the big flashy ones will ever be identified.
776280	783480	Unless a specialist visits your collection and picks out things that are of interest.
783480	783880	Thanks, guys.
783920	784260	Thanks, guys.
784320	785360	Thanks.
785400	787660	Thanks.
789860	796420	Yeah.
