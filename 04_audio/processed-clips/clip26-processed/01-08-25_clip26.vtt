WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
Saphida demelis is a noctuid that looks a little bit like one of the agiris species and also one

00:16.120 --> 00:27.060
species in a different genus so if you're not careful you can pin the wrong name on all you

00:27.060 --> 00:32.040
can confuse all three of those species with one another when we get to the other species I'll

00:32.040 --> 00:44.580
I'll point out what it was Sudixentera habrazana is a tartricid that feeds on oaks and flies in the

00:44.580 --> 00:54.120
winter months I got one in Davis for the first time either last year or the year before and it's

00:54.120 --> 01:04.500
the common early year tartricid at cold cannon but maybe with the oaks getting burned out we

01:04.500 --> 01:12.420
won't see so many in the future oaks are going to take a long time to recover because you know you

01:12.420 --> 01:42.400
get seedlings right away but a mighty oak takes years yeah Pseudobryomima phallax this is a noctuaid that feeds on ferns and Tim McCabe worked you know he wanted to rear it because he didn't know the food plant but I have previously reared it from San Bruno mountain but I called it a different species and those two species are easily confused with one of the other species that I've ever seen in the

01:42.400 --> 01:58.400
So whether this phallus is the correct name or not I don't know but this is the name McCabe used and he's an expert on noctuaids so it's probably correct but potentially we have two different species here

01:58.400 --> 02:04.400
And the other species I think it's called Muscosa

02:04.400 --> 02:05.400
M-U-S-C-O-S-A

02:05.400 --> 02:08.400
Yeah

02:08.400 --> 02:10.400
Yeah

02:10.400 --> 02:13.400
Terratea

02:13.400 --> 02:22.400
This is a confusing genus of gray, white and black moth

02:22.400 --> 02:32.400
And Wagner recently told me that he thinks that the monograph that Fred Rinds did is totally messed up

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
But

02:34.400 --> 02:36.400
But he has a bad opinion of him

02:36.400 --> 02:38.400
Yeah, he has no respect for him

02:38.400 --> 02:48.400
Terratea can be confused with similar looking genera in the tribe Bistinini

02:48.400 --> 02:52.400
You know, Bistin betularia is the famous

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
Salt and pepper moth

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
Yeah

02:56.400 --> 03:07.400
So the two that were most confused with one another were Terratea succurba and one that begins with L and I don't have the name

03:07.400 --> 03:11.400
The Mary area I think is the other ones

03:11.400 --> 03:19.400
And they look very very similar to one another but one has longer palpy than the other

03:19.400 --> 03:23.400
And once you sort them out by palpy and you have them side by side

03:23.400 --> 03:29.400
They don't look, the ones with longer palpy don't look like the ones with the shorter palpy

03:29.400 --> 03:33.400
But the difference in palpy length is very very subtle

03:33.400 --> 03:35.400
And

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
There is

03:37.400 --> 03:43.400
I called everything succurba in the beginning but probably some of those are misidentified

03:43.400 --> 03:45.400
And I think I have a

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
A

03:47.400 --> 03:49.400
La Mary area or succurba

03:49.400 --> 03:51.400
Entry at the table

03:51.400 --> 03:53.400
To

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
Deal with the specimens that I didn't retain

03:55.400 --> 03:59.400
But recent ones I've been careful about

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400
I was more careful about identifying them

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
This

04:03.400 --> 04:05.400
Pyralini

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
Pyralis question mark

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
It's a common moth and

04:09.400 --> 04:15.400
I think we could probably give it a name but I don't know whether it'd be the good name

04:15.400 --> 04:17.400
But I think it's all one species

04:17.400 --> 04:19.400
And

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
Somewhat similar

04:21.400 --> 04:23.400
Excuse me to Arta

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
A-R-T-A

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
And some other

04:31.400 --> 04:33.400
Cram vines

04:33.400 --> 04:39.400
I guess it's a pyralid

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
It's a true pyralid

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
It's just a pyralion

04:42.400 --> 04:47.400
Pyrausta

04:47.400 --> 04:49.400
Moranalis

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Pyrausta

04:50.400 --> 04:54.400
Some of the species are hard to tell apart from one another

04:54.400 --> 04:56.400
Moranalis is one of them

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
And

04:57.400 --> 04:59.400
But

04:59.400 --> 05:02.400
The ones that it is most confused with

05:02.400 --> 05:05.400
Don't seem to be at Cold Canyon

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
But

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
There is one in my backyard

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
That's fairly common

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
That

05:10.400 --> 05:13.400
Has one form that resembles this

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
Quasi

05:16.400 --> 05:19.400
Salabria

05:19.400 --> 05:22.400
Has been moved from genus to genus to genus

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
Recently

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
And

05:25.400 --> 05:31.400
I think it feeds on oaks

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
Feeds on oaks

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
But I'm not certain about it

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
It's a Fisotime pyralid

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
It's a Fisotime pyralid

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
Raphia

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Freighter

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
Cinderella

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
It went under the name of Cinderella

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Um

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
And then

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
Several

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
Putative species

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
Were

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Um

05:49.400 --> 05:52.400
Are now listed as subspecies of freighter

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Uh

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
This one feeds on willow

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
I know

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
That

05:57.400 --> 06:06.400
Recurve area

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
New species

06:07.400 --> 06:16.400
I can't think of the genus for that

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
No

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
Oh, okay

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
Um

06:19.400 --> 06:22.400
I think this is a galicaid

06:22.400 --> 06:26.400
And it was one that there's a manuscript name exists for it

06:26.400 --> 06:29.400
And it's a fairly distinct one

06:29.400 --> 06:32.400
I think it's one of the oak species that um

06:32.400 --> 06:34.400
Uh

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
Opler reared

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
In his

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
Oaksis islands

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Work

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
Cool

06:39.400 --> 06:45.400
Rutenia sabiniana

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
Um

06:46.400 --> 06:49.400
Feeds on pinus sabiniana

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
Obviously

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
It's a

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
Oathrutine

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
Um

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
Tortricid

06:54.400 --> 06:58.400
Easy to identify

06:58.400 --> 06:59.400
Um

06:59.400 --> 07:00.400
The generic placement

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
The

07:02.400 --> 07:06.400
The former placement was synonymized with Rutenia

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
Um

07:07.400 --> 07:08.400
Recently

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
So early

07:09.400 --> 07:10.400
Spreadsheets

07:10.400 --> 07:11.400
It's in the genus Petrova

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
Cephania

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
Cephania

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400

Cephania

07:43.400 --> 07:46.400
Cephania

07:46.400 --> 07:51.080
There's a manuscript for a monograph that's well under the way,

07:51.080 --> 07:59.500
but the biggest genus was being done by a co-author of the two volumes,

07:59.780 --> 08:03.340
two or more volumes that it will be, and he passed away.

08:05.360 --> 08:13.320
And he hadn't been making progress to the satisfaction of the other authors.

08:13.320 --> 08:20.020
I don't know if and when this will be published, but it could be coming.

08:21.700 --> 08:30.280
Scoperia pallilaris. Scoperia are crambids that feed on mosses,

08:31.500 --> 08:39.140
and I think this is the name for it, just based on similarity to photographs of it,

08:39.140 --> 08:45.320
but it might be something else, and it could be more than one species.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.760
Powell was reluctant to put a name on it for me.

08:52.920 --> 09:00.960
Scrobipopula lutecella is a noramoshmine.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.500
Noramoshmine is G-N-O-R.

09:03.500 --> 09:12.000
Delikia, and it feeds on Indian paintbrush.

09:15.120 --> 09:20.640
And it's one of the few noramoshmines that I can put a name on,

09:21.460 --> 09:27.560
but potentially there's a similar-looking species that I don't know about,

09:27.560 --> 09:32.380
but I think what I've been calling this are all one species, but I can't be sure.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.060
Seracosima, I think there's three or four species of Seracosima,

09:37.200 --> 09:41.960
all of which are at Cold Canyon,

09:42.300 --> 09:45.760
and I have dissected a number of them.

09:45.760 --> 09:55.820
This was one of the groups that Ringe worked on and so far has not met with scorn from Wagner,

09:56.040 --> 09:58.280
so I think it's pretty good.

09:58.360 --> 10:04.100
The genitalia separate into two different species,

10:04.240 --> 10:08.920
but you can tell them apart, most of them apart, on the basis of wing pattern.

10:08.920 --> 10:14.000
But there are some similarities between the two.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.780
I'm surprised that this is the only one that made it.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.520
I got one specimen in Davis, but

10:20.520 --> 10:25.600
Slossonia rubartinka is a fairly distinct moth.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.140
Noctua, I don't know very much about it.

10:30.140 --> 10:38.820
Sosipatria therberii is a phisotine pyralid,

10:38.820 --> 10:48.060
and like most phisotines, looks like most other phisotines.

10:48.720 --> 10:54.380
You know, it's just one with white and black and every shade of gray in between.

10:54.380 --> 11:05.880
It has kind of a more prominent medial band that makes it somewhat recognizable,

11:06.220 --> 11:09.200
but I cannot swear that I've recorded every specimen.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.700
I believe it's an oak moth.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.460
Spargania magnoliata.

11:17.460 --> 11:24.820
Spargania magnoliata, this is a geometride with a kind of,

11:24.820 --> 11:28.420
it's kind of, I think it's among what they call carpet moths,

11:28.420 --> 11:33.100
but only because it looks kind of like a carpet.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.900
And the hind wing is kind of pinkish out here,

11:37.020 --> 11:40.920
but in other parts of the distribution,

11:41.160 --> 11:43.220
I think this is a transcontinental species,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.780
the hind wing is less pinkish than out here.

11:47.460 --> 11:54.660
And I think even within California, there are some different ones.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.800
So subspecific names have been given to various populations.

11:59.860 --> 12:02.340
And it could be that when they look at them closer,

12:02.560 --> 12:07.460
there's more than one species are in magnoliata.

12:09.820 --> 12:16.820
Sparganothus senecionana is the tortrici that I mentioned feeds on low-growing plants,

12:16.820 --> 12:18.700
so it's abundant after fire,

12:18.700 --> 12:22.660
and you get a lot of low-growing plants,

12:22.660 --> 12:28.900
quite polyphagous.

12:28.900 --> 12:33.900
But even when there hasn't been a fire for a while,

12:33.900 --> 12:35.560
you still get them.

12:35.560 --> 12:45.400
But archips then becomes the most common tortricid instead of Sparganothus.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.600
Spodoptera exigula, we talked about before.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.860
This is a non-native species.

12:52.620 --> 12:56.380
But it's, you know, it's a major pest species now.

12:58.180 --> 12:59.660
Spodoptera prefica.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.060
This is one I mentioned before.

13:04.160 --> 13:08.380
There's a similar-looking species that's been reported from our area,

13:08.380 --> 13:10.200
but I haven't seen that one.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.440
That's the yellow-striped army worm or something like that.

13:17.260 --> 13:23.140
Stamnodes is the genus that Wagner student Tanner Mattson is working on.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.640
And one, two, three.

13:28.980 --> 13:32.480
I think this is most of the species, but not all of them.

13:32.480 --> 13:40.820
And Affiliata, what is going under the name Affiliata,

13:40.980 --> 13:42.820
is apparently more than one species.

13:43.520 --> 13:51.060
And Wagner told me that ours are not Affiliata of Southern California.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.740
But without knowing where the type locality is,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.140
I don't know which ones are the true Affiliata

13:58.140 --> 14:01.640
and which ones are the pseudo-Affiliata.

14:02.480 --> 14:08.420
These Stamnodes is a very, very difficult genus.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.860
But when you dissect them,

14:09.960 --> 14:13.960
the genitalia are very different from one another.

14:14.780 --> 14:20.360
And I chose to call the most common species,

14:20.540 --> 14:21.580
Ceno nymphata.

14:21.820 --> 14:28.560
But this one probably will include a number of synonyms

14:28.560 --> 14:31.380
that are currently listed as valid species.

14:32.480 --> 14:39.160
And Tanner is keeping his work pretty close to the breast for now.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.860
And, you know, he's got a postdoc at the Smithsonian.

14:41.860 --> 14:47.060
So it seems like, you know, he's very productive,

14:47.200 --> 14:50.700
but it seems like he's involved in something else at the Smithsonian.

14:50.700 --> 14:55.340
And it may be a while before we get the last word on this.

14:55.340 --> 15:00.180
Uluwata is a very distinct one.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.340
All of these fly in the winter months.

15:04.340 --> 15:14.340
And the early one, there's different species fly in late fall to early winter,

15:14.560 --> 15:15.660
then fly in.

15:16.080 --> 15:21.180
So the ones you get at the end of the year are, in the most part,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.480
different than the ones you get in the early years.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.400
But there's a few that cross over.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.760
And probably with more collection dates in late December and early January,

15:31.700 --> 15:33.660
you'd find that there's more.

15:33.820 --> 15:37.280
But the latest ones are different than the earliest ones.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.780
Still, Boses, Dulcito.

15:41.780 --> 15:48.440
I'm trying to blank on this for the moment.

15:52.700 --> 15:53.320
It's okay.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.960
We can skip it for now.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.560
Yeah.

15:57.660 --> 15:58.820
I'll make a note.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.380
I'll look it up when I review the notes.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.620
Stretia pacificus.

16:03.720 --> 16:08.380
Stretia is a genus of noctuids.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.520
They're very attractive-looking noctuids.

16:12.600 --> 16:20.700
And most of the species you can't identify by genitalia.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.500
But the patterns are very distinct from one another.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.900
And we were giving this a different name,

16:27.980 --> 16:31.640
but it turned out Stretia pacifica, the female genitalia,

16:31.640 --> 16:35.700
is different than the genitalia of the other species.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.480
So once I dissected the genitalia of the female,

16:39.480 --> 16:43.100
then this was the name we decided to use.

16:43.100 --> 16:47.400
It feeds on ribes,

16:47.400 --> 16:52.240
or whatever ribes is being called now.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.740
I think it's been divided into two genera.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.300
Like currents?

16:57.660 --> 16:58.040
Pardon me?

16:58.220 --> 16:58.780
Currents.

16:59.200 --> 16:59.480
Yeah.

16:59.480 --> 17:04.480
But I think that some are ribes,

17:04.560 --> 17:05.620
and some are, you know,

17:05.660 --> 17:08.040
on the basis of whether they have spiny fruit or not.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.880
There's some character.

17:11.880 --> 17:16.820
The Simoca signatella we discussed in Davis.

17:17.260 --> 17:20.800
This might be an introduced species.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.220
I don't know much about it,

17:22.220 --> 17:24.680
but it's, you know,

17:24.720 --> 17:26.020
it's in that small family,

17:26.140 --> 17:27.100
Autostickidae,

17:27.300 --> 17:32.380
and formerly placed in Blastobasidae,

17:32.640 --> 17:37.960
and I think it's been bounced around in different families.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.060
Synchora errata licoriae is another green geometry.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.260
This is a common species in Davis.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.340
And it was a,

17:53.420 --> 18:00.000
the caterpillar was a cover boy or cover girl on Science one year.

18:01.020 --> 18:01.180
So,

18:01.520 --> 18:06.160
and the person who wrote that article came out to Cold Canyon with me.

18:06.400 --> 18:06.500
So,

18:08.500 --> 18:08.920
I was,

18:09.700 --> 18:10.520
so that's,

18:10.860 --> 18:11.100
you know,

18:11.180 --> 18:12.260
the name seemed familiar.

18:12.260 --> 18:18.580
Tealeopsis baldiana is a galakia that feeds on poison oak.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.480
And it's a specialist.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.080
I have not reared it.

18:25.740 --> 18:25.960
I don't.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.100
Fair.

18:27.640 --> 18:27.840
Yeah.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.860
But Powell has.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.000
And it's,

18:34.180 --> 18:35.960
it's fairly easy to recognize.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.400
So I think all I recorded.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.480
And poison oak,

18:41.680 --> 18:42.340
you know,

18:43.220 --> 18:44.160
burns readily.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.300
It disappears late in the year,

18:47.420 --> 18:49.180
but it regenerates rapidly.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.160
And can get up to enormous sizes.

18:52.560 --> 18:52.740
You know,

18:52.760 --> 18:54.760
it gets to be as big as,

18:55.120 --> 18:57.980
gets tree sized in many places.

18:59.980 --> 19:00.620
I'm,

19:00.620 --> 19:01.340
and I don't.
