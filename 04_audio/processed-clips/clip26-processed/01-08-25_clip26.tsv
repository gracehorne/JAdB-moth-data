0	16120	Saphida demelis is a noctuid that looks a little bit like one of the agiris species and also one
16120	27060	species in a different genus so if you're not careful you can pin the wrong name on all you
27060	32040	can confuse all three of those species with one another when we get to the other species I'll
32040	44580	I'll point out what it was Sudixentera habrazana is a tartricid that feeds on oaks and flies in the
44580	54120	winter months I got one in Davis for the first time either last year or the year before and it's
54120	64500	the common early year tartricid at cold cannon but maybe with the oaks getting burned out we
64500	72420	won't see so many in the future oaks are going to take a long time to recover because you know you
72420	102400	get seedlings right away but a mighty oak takes years yeah Pseudobryomima phallax this is a noctuaid that feeds on ferns and Tim McCabe worked you know he wanted to rear it because he didn't know the food plant but I have previously reared it from San Bruno mountain but I called it a different species and those two species are easily confused with one of the other species that I've ever seen in the
102400	118400	So whether this phallus is the correct name or not I don't know but this is the name McCabe used and he's an expert on noctuaids so it's probably correct but potentially we have two different species here
118400	124400	And the other species I think it's called Muscosa
124400	125400	M-U-S-C-O-S-A
125400	128400	Yeah
128400	130400	Yeah
130400	133400	Terratea
133400	142400	This is a confusing genus of gray, white and black moth
142400	152400	And Wagner recently told me that he thinks that the monograph that Fred Rinds did is totally messed up
152400	154400	But
154400	156400	But he has a bad opinion of him
156400	158400	Yeah, he has no respect for him
158400	168400	Terratea can be confused with similar looking genera in the tribe Bistinini
168400	172400	You know, Bistin betularia is the famous
172400	174400	Salt and pepper moth
174400	176400	Yeah
176400	187400	So the two that were most confused with one another were Terratea succurba and one that begins with L and I don't have the name
187400	191400	The Mary area I think is the other ones
191400	199400	And they look very very similar to one another but one has longer palpy than the other
199400	203400	And once you sort them out by palpy and you have them side by side
203400	209400	They don't look, the ones with longer palpy don't look like the ones with the shorter palpy
209400	213400	But the difference in palpy length is very very subtle
213400	215400	And
215400	217400	There is
217400	223400	I called everything succurba in the beginning but probably some of those are misidentified
223400	225400	And I think I have a
225400	227400	A
227400	229400	La Mary area or succurba
229400	231400	Entry at the table
231400	233400	To
233400	235400	Deal with the specimens that I didn't retain
235400	239400	But recent ones I've been careful about
239400	241400	I was more careful about identifying them
241400	243400	This
243400	245400	Pyralini
245400	247400	Pyralis question mark
247400	249400	It's a common moth and
249400	255400	I think we could probably give it a name but I don't know whether it'd be the good name
255400	257400	But I think it's all one species
257400	259400	And
259400	261400	Somewhat similar
261400	263400	Excuse me to Arta
263400	265400	A-R-T-A
269400	271400	And some other
271400	273400	Cram vines
273400	279400	I guess it's a pyralid
279400	280400	It's a true pyralid
280400	282400	It's just a pyralion
282400	287400	Pyrausta
287400	289400	Moranalis
289400	290400	Pyrausta
290400	294400	Some of the species are hard to tell apart from one another
294400	296400	Moranalis is one of them
296400	297400	And
297400	299400	But
299400	302400	The ones that it is most confused with
302400	305400	Don't seem to be at Cold Canyon
305400	306400	But
306400	308400	There is one in my backyard
308400	309400	That's fairly common
309400	310400	That
310400	313400	Has one form that resembles this
313400	316400	Quasi
316400	319400	Salabria
319400	322400	Has been moved from genus to genus to genus
322400	324400	Recently
324400	325400	And
325400	331400	I think it feeds on oaks
331400	332400	Feeds on oaks
332400	333400	But I'm not certain about it
333400	334400	It's a Fisotime pyralid
334400	335400	It's a Fisotime pyralid
337400	338400	Raphia
338400	339400	Freighter
339400	340400	Cinderella
340400	342400	It went under the name of Cinderella
342400	343400	Um
343400	344400	And then
344400	345400	Several
345400	347400	Putative species
347400	348400	Were
348400	349400	Um
349400	352400	Are now listed as subspecies of freighter
352400	353400	Uh
353400	355400	This one feeds on willow
355400	356400	I know
356400	357400	That
357400	366400	Recurve area
366400	367400	New species
367400	376400	I can't think of the genus for that
376400	377400	No
377400	378400	Oh, okay
378400	379400	Um
379400	382400	I think this is a galicaid
382400	386400	And it was one that there's a manuscript name exists for it
386400	389400	And it's a fairly distinct one
389400	392400	I think it's one of the oak species that um
392400	394400	Uh
394400	395400	Opler reared
395400	396400	In his
396400	397400	Oaksis islands
397400	398400	Work
398400	399400	Cool
399400	405400	Rutenia sabiniana
405400	406400	Um
406400	409400	Feeds on pinus sabiniana
409400	410400	Obviously
410400	411400	It's a
411400	412400	Oathrutine
412400	413400	Um
413400	414400	Tortricid
414400	418400	Easy to identify
418400	419400	Um
419400	420400	The generic placement
420400	422400	The
422400	426400	The former placement was synonymized with Rutenia
426400	427400	Um
427400	428400	Recently
428400	429400	So early
429400	430400	Spreadsheets
430400	431400	It's in the genus Petrova

466400	471080	There's a manuscript for a monograph that's well under the way,
471080	479500	but the biggest genus was being done by a co-author of the two volumes,
479780	483340	two or more volumes that it will be, and he passed away.
485360	493320	And he hadn't been making progress to the satisfaction of the other authors.
493320	500020	I don't know if and when this will be published, but it could be coming.
501700	510280	Scoperia pallilaris. Scoperia are crambids that feed on mosses,
511500	519140	and I think this is the name for it, just based on similarity to photographs of it,
519140	525320	but it might be something else, and it could be more than one species.
528840	531760	Powell was reluctant to put a name on it for me.
532920	540960	Scrobipopula lutecella is a noramoshmine.
541420	543500	Noramoshmine is G-N-O-R.
543500	552000	Delikia, and it feeds on Indian paintbrush.
555120	560640	And it's one of the few noramoshmines that I can put a name on,
561460	567560	but potentially there's a similar-looking species that I don't know about,
567560	572380	but I think what I've been calling this are all one species, but I can't be sure.
573920	577060	Seracosima, I think there's three or four species of Seracosima,
577200	581960	all of which are at Cold Canyon,
582300	585760	and I have dissected a number of them.
585760	595820	This was one of the groups that Ringe worked on and so far has not met with scorn from Wagner,
596040	598280	so I think it's pretty good.
598360	604100	The genitalia separate into two different species,
604240	608920	but you can tell them apart, most of them apart, on the basis of wing pattern.
608920	614000	But there are some similarities between the two.
614440	617780	I'm surprised that this is the only one that made it.
617920	620520	I got one specimen in Davis, but
620520	625600	Slossonia rubartinka is a fairly distinct moth.
627680	630140	Noctua, I don't know very much about it.
630140	638820	Sosipatria therberii is a phisotine pyralid,
638820	648060	and like most phisotines, looks like most other phisotines.
648720	654380	You know, it's just one with white and black and every shade of gray in between.
654380	665880	It has kind of a more prominent medial band that makes it somewhat recognizable,
666220	669200	but I cannot swear that I've recorded every specimen.
669680	671700	I believe it's an oak moth.
675600	677460	Spargania magnoliata.
677460	684820	Spargania magnoliata, this is a geometride with a kind of,
684820	688420	it's kind of, I think it's among what they call carpet moths,
688420	693100	but only because it looks kind of like a carpet.
694260	696900	And the hind wing is kind of pinkish out here,
697020	700920	but in other parts of the distribution,
701160	703220	I think this is a transcontinental species,
703920	706780	the hind wing is less pinkish than out here.
707460	714660	And I think even within California, there are some different ones.
714780	718800	So subspecific names have been given to various populations.
719860	722340	And it could be that when they look at them closer,
722560	727460	there's more than one species are in magnoliata.
729820	736820	Sparganothus senecionana is the tortrici that I mentioned feeds on low-growing plants,
736820	738700	so it's abundant after fire,
738700	742660	and you get a lot of low-growing plants,
742660	748900	quite polyphagous.
748900	753900	But even when there hasn't been a fire for a while,
753900	755560	you still get them.
755560	765400	But archips then becomes the most common tortricid instead of Sparganothus.
766200	768600	Spodoptera exigula, we talked about before.
768600	770860	This is a non-native species.
772620	776380	But it's, you know, it's a major pest species now.
778180	779660	Spodoptera prefica.
782400	784060	This is one I mentioned before.
784160	788380	There's a similar-looking species that's been reported from our area,
788380	790200	but I haven't seen that one.
791240	794440	That's the yellow-striped army worm or something like that.
797260	803140	Stamnodes is the genus that Wagner student Tanner Mattson is working on.
804440	808640	And one, two, three.
808980	812480	I think this is most of the species, but not all of them.
812480	820820	And Affiliata, what is going under the name Affiliata,
820980	822820	is apparently more than one species.
823520	831060	And Wagner told me that ours are not Affiliata of Southern California.
832760	835740	But without knowing where the type locality is,
835800	838140	I don't know which ones are the true Affiliata
838140	841640	and which ones are the pseudo-Affiliata.
842480	848420	These Stamnodes is a very, very difficult genus.
848620	849860	But when you dissect them,
849960	853960	the genitalia are very different from one another.
854780	860360	And I chose to call the most common species,
860540	861580	Ceno nymphata.
861820	868560	But this one probably will include a number of synonyms
868560	871380	that are currently listed as valid species.
872480	879160	And Tanner is keeping his work pretty close to the breast for now.
879360	881860	And, you know, he's got a postdoc at the Smithsonian.
881860	887060	So it seems like, you know, he's very productive,
887200	890700	but it seems like he's involved in something else at the Smithsonian.
890700	895340	And it may be a while before we get the last word on this.
895340	900180	Uluwata is a very distinct one.
900280	904340	All of these fly in the winter months.
904340	914340	And the early one, there's different species fly in late fall to early winter,
914560	915660	then fly in.
916080	921180	So the ones you get at the end of the year are, in the most part,
921400	923480	different than the ones you get in the early years.
923480	925400	But there's a few that cross over.
926600	930760	And probably with more collection dates in late December and early January,
931700	933660	you'd find that there's more.
933820	937280	But the latest ones are different than the earliest ones.
939680	941780	Still, Boses, Dulcito.
941780	948440	I'm trying to blank on this for the moment.
952700	953320	It's okay.
954700	955960	We can skip it for now.
955960	956560	Yeah.
957660	958820	I'll make a note.
959140	961380	I'll look it up when I review the notes.
962400	963620	Stretia pacificus.
963720	968380	Stretia is a genus of noctuids.
968920	971520	They're very attractive-looking noctuids.
972600	980700	And most of the species you can't identify by genitalia.
981120	984500	But the patterns are very distinct from one another.
985640	987900	And we were giving this a different name,
987980	991640	but it turned out Stretia pacifica, the female genitalia,
991640	995700	is different than the genitalia of the other species.
995960	999480	So once I dissected the genitalia of the female,
999480	1003100	then this was the name we decided to use.
1003100	1007400	It feeds on ribes,
1007400	1012240	or whatever ribes is being called now.
1012240	1015740	I think it's been divided into two genera.
1016440	1017300	Like currents?
1017660	1018040	Pardon me?
1018220	1018780	Currents.
1019200	1019480	Yeah.
1019480	1024480	But I think that some are ribes,
1024560	1025620	and some are, you know,
1025660	1028040	on the basis of whether they have spiny fruit or not.
1028820	1031880	There's some character.
1031880	1036820	The Simoca signatella we discussed in Davis.
1037260	1040800	This might be an introduced species.
1040900	1042220	I don't know much about it,
1042220	1044680	but it's, you know,
1044720	1046020	it's in that small family,
1046140	1047100	Autostickidae,
1047300	1052380	and formerly placed in Blastobasidae,
1052640	1057960	and I think it's been bounced around in different families.
1061840	1067060	Synchora errata licoriae is another green geometry.
1067060	1069260	This is a common species in Davis.
1070360	1072340	And it was a,
1073420	1080000	the caterpillar was a cover boy or cover girl on Science one year.
1081020	1081180	So,
1081520	1086160	and the person who wrote that article came out to Cold Canyon with me.
1086400	1086500	So,
1088500	1088920	I was,
1089700	1090520	so that's,
1090860	1091100	you know,
1091180	1092260	the name seemed familiar.
1092260	1098580	Tealeopsis baldiana is a galakia that feeds on poison oak.
1099120	1101480	And it's a specialist.
1103480	1105080	I have not reared it.
1105740	1105960	I don't.
1106580	1107100	Fair.
1107640	1107840	Yeah.
1108840	1110860	But Powell has.
1113140	1114000	And it's,
1114180	1115960	it's fairly easy to recognize.
1116180	1117400	So I think all I recorded.
1117400	1121480	And poison oak,
1121680	1122340	you know,
1123220	1124160	burns readily.
1124740	1127300	It disappears late in the year,
1127420	1129180	but it regenerates rapidly.
1129680	1132160	And can get up to enormous sizes.
1132560	1132740	You know,
1132760	1134760	it gets to be as big as,
1135120	1137980	gets tree sized in many places.
1139980	1140620	I'm,
1140620	1141340	and I don't.
