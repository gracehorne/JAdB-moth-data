1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Saphida demelis is a noctuid that looks a little bit like one of the agiris species and also one

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:27,060
species in a different genus so if you're not careful you can pin the wrong name on all you

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,040
can confuse all three of those species with one another when we get to the other species I'll

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:44,580
I'll point out what it was Sudixentera habrazana is a tartricid that feeds on oaks and flies in the

5
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:54,120
winter months I got one in Davis for the first time either last year or the year before and it's

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:04,500
the common early year tartricid at cold cannon but maybe with the oaks getting burned out we

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,420
won't see so many in the future oaks are going to take a long time to recover because you know you

8
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:42,400
get seedlings right away but a mighty oak takes years yeah Pseudobryomima phallax this is a noctuaid that feeds on ferns and Tim McCabe worked you know he wanted to rear it because he didn't know the food plant but I have previously reared it from San Bruno mountain but I called it a different species and those two species are easily confused with one of the other species that I've ever seen in the

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:58,400
So whether this phallus is the correct name or not I don't know but this is the name McCabe used and he's an expert on noctuaids so it's probably correct but potentially we have two different species here

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,400
And the other species I think it's called Muscosa

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
M-U-S-C-O-S-A

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Yeah

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Terratea

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:22,400
This is a confusing genus of gray, white and black moth

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,400
And Wagner recently told me that he thinks that the monograph that Fred Rinds did is totally messed up

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
But

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
But he has a bad opinion of him

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah, he has no respect for him

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Terratea can be confused with similar looking genera in the tribe Bistinini

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You know, Bistin betularia is the famous

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Salt and pepper moth

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Yeah

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:07,400
So the two that were most confused with one another were Terratea succurba and one that begins with L and I don't have the name

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
The Mary area I think is the other ones

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,400
And they look very very similar to one another but one has longer palpy than the other

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
And once you sort them out by palpy and you have them side by side

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,400
They don't look, the ones with longer palpy don't look like the ones with the shorter palpy

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
But the difference in palpy length is very very subtle

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
And

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
There is

32
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I called everything succurba in the beginning but probably some of those are misidentified

33
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
And I think I have a

34
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
A

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
La Mary area or succurba

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Entry at the table

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
To

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Deal with the specimens that I didn't retain

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
But recent ones I've been careful about

40
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I was more careful about identifying them

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
This

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Pyralini

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Pyralis question mark

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It's a common moth and

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I think we could probably give it a name but I don't know whether it'd be the good name

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
But I think it's all one species

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
And

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Somewhat similar

49
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Excuse me to Arta

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
A-R-T-A

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
And some other

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Cram vines

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I guess it's a pyralid

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
It's a true pyralid

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
It's just a pyralion

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Pyrausta

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Moranalis

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Pyrausta

59
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Some of the species are hard to tell apart from one another

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Moranalis is one of them

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
And

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
But

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
The ones that it is most confused with

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Don't seem to be at Cold Canyon

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
But

66
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
There is one in my backyard

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
That's fairly common

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
That

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Has one form that resembles this

70
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Quasi

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Salabria

72
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Has been moved from genus to genus to genus

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Recently

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
And

75
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I think it feeds on oaks

76
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Feeds on oaks

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
But I'm not certain about it

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
It's a Fisotime pyralid

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
It's a Fisotime pyralid

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Raphia

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Freighter

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Cinderella

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
It went under the name of Cinderella

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Um

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
And then

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Several

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Putative species

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Were

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Um

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Are now listed as subspecies of freighter

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Uh

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
This one feeds on willow

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I know

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
That

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Recurve area

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
New species

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I can't think of the genus for that

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
No

99
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh, okay

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Um

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I think this is a galicaid

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
And it was one that there's a manuscript name exists for it

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
And it's a fairly distinct one

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I think it's one of the oak species that um

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Uh

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Opler reared

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
In his

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Oaksis islands

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Work

110
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Cool

111
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Rutenia sabiniana

112
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Um

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Feeds on pinus sabiniana

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Obviously

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
It's a

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Oathrutine

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Um

118
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Tortricid

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Easy to identify

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Um

121
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
The generic placement

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
The

123
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
The former placement was synonymized with Rutenia

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Um

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Recently

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
So early

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Spreadsheets

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
It's in the genus Petrova

129
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Cephania

130
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400

Cephania

156
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,080
There's a manuscript for a monograph that's well under the way,

157
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:59,500
but the biggest genus was being done by a co-author of the two volumes,

158
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,340
two or more volumes that it will be, and he passed away.

159
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,320
And he hadn't been making progress to the satisfaction of the other authors.

160
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,020
I don't know if and when this will be published, but it could be coming.

161
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:30,280
Scoperia pallilaris. Scoperia are crambids that feed on mosses,

162
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,140
and I think this is the name for it, just based on similarity to photographs of it,

163
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,320
but it might be something else, and it could be more than one species.

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Powell was reluctant to put a name on it for me.

165
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Scrobipopula lutecella is a noramoshmine.

166
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,500
Noramoshmine is G-N-O-R.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Delikia, and it feeds on Indian paintbrush.

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,640
And it's one of the few noramoshmines that I can put a name on,

169
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,560
but potentially there's a similar-looking species that I don't know about,

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,380
but I think what I've been calling this are all one species, but I can't be sure.

171
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,060
Seracosima, I think there's three or four species of Seracosima,

172
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,960
all of which are at Cold Canyon,

173
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,760
and I have dissected a number of them.

174
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:55,820
This was one of the groups that Ringe worked on and so far has not met with scorn from Wagner,

175
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
so I think it's pretty good.

176
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,100
The genitalia separate into two different species,

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,920
but you can tell them apart, most of them apart, on the basis of wing pattern.

178
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,000
But there are some similarities between the two.

179
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,780
I'm surprised that this is the only one that made it.

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,520
I got one specimen in Davis, but

181
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,600
Slossonia rubartinka is a fairly distinct moth.

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,140
Noctua, I don't know very much about it.

183
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:38,820
Sosipatria therberii is a phisotine pyralid,

184
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:48,060
and like most phisotines, looks like most other phisotines.

185
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,380
You know, it's just one with white and black and every shade of gray in between.

186
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:05,880
It has kind of a more prominent medial band that makes it somewhat recognizable,

187
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,200
but I cannot swear that I've recorded every specimen.

188
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,700
I believe it's an oak moth.

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,460
Spargania magnoliata.

190
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,820
Spargania magnoliata, this is a geometride with a kind of,

191
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,420
it's kind of, I think it's among what they call carpet moths,

192
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,100
but only because it looks kind of like a carpet.

193
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,900
And the hind wing is kind of pinkish out here,

194
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,920
but in other parts of the distribution,

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,220
I think this is a transcontinental species,

196
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,780
the hind wing is less pinkish than out here.

197
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:54,660
And I think even within California, there are some different ones.

198
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,800
So subspecific names have been given to various populations.

199
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,340
And it could be that when they look at them closer,

200
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,460
there's more than one species are in magnoliata.

201
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Sparganothus senecionana is the tortrici that I mentioned feeds on low-growing plants,

202
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,700
so it's abundant after fire,

203
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,660
and you get a lot of low-growing plants,

204
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,900
quite polyphagous.

205
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,900
But even when there hasn't been a fire for a while,

206
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,560
you still get them.

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:45,400
But archips then becomes the most common tortricid instead of Sparganothus.

208
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,600
Spodoptera exigula, we talked about before.

209
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,860
This is a non-native species.

210
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,380
But it's, you know, it's a major pest species now.

211
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,660
Spodoptera prefica.

212
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,060
This is one I mentioned before.

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,380
There's a similar-looking species that's been reported from our area,

214
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,200
but I haven't seen that one.

215
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,440
That's the yellow-striped army worm or something like that.

216
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,140
Stamnodes is the genus that Wagner student Tanner Mattson is working on.

217
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,640
And one, two, three.

218
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,480
I think this is most of the species, but not all of them.

219
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:40,820
And Affiliata, what is going under the name Affiliata,

220
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,820
is apparently more than one species.

221
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:51,060
And Wagner told me that ours are not Affiliata of Southern California.

222
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,740
But without knowing where the type locality is,

223
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,140
I don't know which ones are the true Affiliata

224
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,640
and which ones are the pseudo-Affiliata.

225
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,420
These Stamnodes is a very, very difficult genus.

226
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,860
But when you dissect them,

227
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,960
the genitalia are very different from one another.

228
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,360
And I chose to call the most common species,

229
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,580
Ceno nymphata.

230
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,560
But this one probably will include a number of synonyms

231
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,380
that are currently listed as valid species.

232
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,160
And Tanner is keeping his work pretty close to the breast for now.

233
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,860
And, you know, he's got a postdoc at the Smithsonian.

234
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,060
So it seems like, you know, he's very productive,

235
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,700
but it seems like he's involved in something else at the Smithsonian.

236
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,340
And it may be a while before we get the last word on this.

237
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,180
Uluwata is a very distinct one.

238
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,340
All of these fly in the winter months.

239
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:14,340
And the early one, there's different species fly in late fall to early winter,

240
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,660
then fly in.

241
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,180
So the ones you get at the end of the year are, in the most part,

242
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,480
different than the ones you get in the early years.

243
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,400
But there's a few that cross over.

244
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,760
And probably with more collection dates in late December and early January,

245
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,660
you'd find that there's more.

246
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,280
But the latest ones are different than the earliest ones.

247
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,780
Still, Boses, Dulcito.

248
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm trying to blank on this for the moment.

249
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,320
It's okay.

250
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,960
We can skip it for now.

251
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
Yeah.

252
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,820
I'll make a note.

253
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,380
I'll look it up when I review the notes.

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,620
Stretia pacificus.

255
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,380
Stretia is a genus of noctuids.

256
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,520
They're very attractive-looking noctuids.

257
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:20,700
And most of the species you can't identify by genitalia.

258
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,500
But the patterns are very distinct from one another.

259
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,900
And we were giving this a different name,

260
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,640
but it turned out Stretia pacifica, the female genitalia,

261
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,700
is different than the genitalia of the other species.

262
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,480
So once I dissected the genitalia of the female,

263
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,100
then this was the name we decided to use.

264
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,400
It feeds on ribes,

265
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,240
or whatever ribes is being called now.

266
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,740
I think it's been divided into two genera.

267
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,300
Like currents?

268
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,040
Pardon me?

269
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,780
Currents.

270
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,480
Yeah.

271
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,480
But I think that some are ribes,

272
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,620
and some are, you know,

273
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,040
on the basis of whether they have spiny fruit or not.

274
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,880
There's some character.

275
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,820
The Simoca signatella we discussed in Davis.

276
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,800
This might be an introduced species.

277
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,220
I don't know much about it,

278
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,680
but it's, you know,

279
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,020
it's in that small family,

280
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,100
Autostickidae,

281
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,380
and formerly placed in Blastobasidae,

282
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,960
and I think it's been bounced around in different families.

283
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,060
Synchora errata licoriae is another green geometry.

284
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,260
This is a common species in Davis.

285
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,340
And it was a,

286
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,000
the caterpillar was a cover boy or cover girl on Science one year.

287
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,180
So,

288
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,160
and the person who wrote that article came out to Cold Canyon with me.

289
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,500
So,

290
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,920
I was,

291
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,520
so that's,

292
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,100
you know,

293
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,260
the name seemed familiar.

294
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,580
Tealeopsis baldiana is a galakia that feeds on poison oak.

295
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,480
And it's a specialist.

296
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,080
I have not reared it.

297
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:25,960
I don't.

298
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,100
Fair.

299
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:27,840
Yeah.

300
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,860
But Powell has.

301
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's,

302
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,960
it's fairly easy to recognize.

303
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,400
So I think all I recorded.

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,480
And poison oak,

305
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,340
you know,

306
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,160
burns readily.

307
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,300
It disappears late in the year,

308
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,180
but it regenerates rapidly.

309
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,160
And can get up to enormous sizes.

310
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,740
You know,

311
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
it gets to be as big as,

312
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,980
gets tree sized in many places.

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm,

314
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,340
and I don't.
