0	6900	throat. Okay, we have started again. So I'm going to skip right by these, except that
6900	15500	for a species seven, I rear from that roost trilobeta, you know, the little shrubby roost
15500	25040	that's there in Cold Canyon. So I have not seen ones that look exactly like this in Davis,
25040	29860	but we don't have roost trilobeta. Did you rear it from a leaf or something? How'd you rear it?
30340	40920	Well, I found the larvae kind of silk-tied some leaves, but they don't make big feeding shelters
40920	48200	the same way that tortricids do, which are often very tightly rolled. But many Gellicheas do make
48200	54500	similar type of feeding structure, you know, but it varies from species to species. Some of them are
54500	59280	internal, some of them are flowers and so forth. But these, I'm pretty sure I just collected the
59280	65140	foliage because I could see leaves, silk-tied leaves. And, you know, the same is true of
65140	70460	that aprorhima on lotus. You can see the leaves tied together.
70460	81380	This thing that says large reddish brown, this is, I believe, a, what's the genus?
81380	84940	It starts with A, obviously.
85340	86400	Aroga or?
86760	87240	What is it?
87400	88800	A-R-O-G-A.
88800	90940	Aroga, yes. It's an aroga.
90940	99440	Aroga, and it resembles this species here, but I don't remember what, that I put here,
99540	106400	aroga, but I don't remember whether it resembles it in the genitalia or in the coloration or
106400	107460	pattern and so forth.
107460	109300	You said genitalia on the note.
109840	111260	Does it say genitalia? Okay.
111960	112280	Okay.
112720	114320	I get the truncated version.
114320	114580	Yeah.
119580	126200	Arta epicinalis is a crambid. I don't know very much about the life history.
126200	134580	There are similar-looking crambids, but it's not in Davis. This is very common, and, you
134580	141520	know, I could have confused some of the similar-looking species with Arta, and there's another species
141520	148420	of Arta, but I'm pretty sure this is the correct, at least one other species that's reported
148420	154020	from this area, but Jerry agrees with me that this is the correct name for it.
156200	174080	Aseptus. All of the Aseptus and related genera were the subject of a revision during the course
174080	185200	of this survey, and I had used specimens in the collection here as the reference for putting
185200	193840	names on them, and it turned out I was wrong in many respects, and it turned out in the
193840	199920	revision there were some erroneous things put there. Like they said one of the species is
199920	206600	a Southern California species, but it's the most common species at Davis and extends much
206600	212980	further north of Davis, so I don't know what's wrong. But, you know, I did some dissections.
212980	217780	A lot of the names were changed and reassigned and everything, and I straightened them out
217780	223660	as best as possible. But there were some that I couldn't identify, and they're in this
223660	229820	bionotata or adnexta, and the reason I couldn't identify them is I didn't have those specimens
229820	244140	on hand anymore. I had assigned names to them based on my pre-revision concepts, and I only
244140	254820	then went back and entered the data for ones that I retained. So, early years, before revision,
254820	265700	pre-revision, there may be underrepresented here. But, except for perfumosa and one that,
266900	271200	perfumosa is the one that I was talking about that's not a Southern California species.
272200	282080	All of these are native. It feeds on chemise, I think, adenostoma, if I remember correctly.
282080	296740	And, um, a septus fumosus, which is very similar to it, also feeds on it. And the author of the
296740	302560	revision said that that's the species we have here. But, you know, after I dissected a number
302560	310020	of them, I couldn't find it until very recently I found two specimens of fumosus that fly a little
310020	318420	bit later than perfumosa. But, they didn't qualify for your list because I only have those two records.
320580	334820	Aspilla prunivora is also in Davis. And this is a occasional pest of, it's a tortricid leaf roller,
334820	338500	occasional pests and orchard crops.
342180	353000	All of the reported hosts, until recently, were, um, cultivated fruits, you know, like prunes and peaches
353000	359380	and that sort of thing. And then, there was a paper that I reviewed, um,
359380	367780	saying that they collected it on a native prunus. And I think that was the first published,
367780	374020	I don't know where the paper got published, the first published record or non-published record
374020	380260	of a native host. And it was collected in the Sierra. So, um,
380260	390980	it suggests that this is a native species that is exploiting, exploiting, uh, orchard crops.
393780	398900	And, uh, I think it has a common name, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.
399860	404660	Autographic Californica is at Davis and we discussed it earlier, but it,
404660	412580	it's a native species. And speaking of Bruce Hammock, you know, he was using, uh,
414100	419300	something from, he was trying to engineer something that had to do with Autographic Californica
420420	429220	for one of his, uh, for, uh, pesticidal usage, but I don't remember what it was. Or there was something
429220	436980	that I think there's a toxin that was. Okay. So it's not just a
439700	446820	pest species, but it's a laboratory. Do you know what its host is? Yeah, it feeds on a lot of things.
446820	454100	Okay. But I think the common name is alfalfa semiluper or something. Oh, okay. It's an
454100	461940	herbidae. Right. I remember talking about that one. Bectra veritana is in Davis feeds on sedges.
466260	469940	And it's a tortricid. Another,
472740	478900	another, a tortricid specialist looked at the array that I had here in the collection
478900	484580	and speculated that were two species. But Jerry Powell, who did describe some species
485620	492180	of Bectra, disagreed and says that they're all veritana, except for two that I got, two or three
492180	499140	that I got in Davis, but not at Cold Canyon. It looks like it might have population cycles, maybe.
499700	508020	Yeah, it could be. Um, under one of my trees, I have a coarse grass that, um, you know, I haven't
508020	514100	looked, but it dies back every year and it could be a sedge. But again, sedges, if they're anywhere,
514100	517940	they're going to be in that drainage ditch along, um,
520900	527220	was it not Russell, the next one, uh, the one that turns into Road 32? Covell. Covell.
529060	534500	I would think that they're in the drainage ditches that haven't been filled in of where they'd be.
534500	540820	And also West Davis Pond, which is only a block from my house. And West Davis Pond goes dry now.
540820	546820	The ditches are getting filled in, particularly now that they're developing that lot next to, uh,
546820	552820	the hospital. So, so maybe that's why these are, but one year it was particularly common and that shows
552820	565700	up there. But, um, um, it's never been as common at, um, at Cold Canyon. And, um,
567220	571700	you know, there I would expect that the sedges are going to be along the creek. And,
572980	579860	you know, what, so I would expect to get more of them down on the lower trail than I would on the east
579860	585700	trail. So is this one native or? Probably native. Yeah. Okay. Probably.
592740	599380	Baphila arameella. I mentioned before, this is the one, this is a physitine pyralid
599380	611460	that's larvae feed on scale insects. So cool. And, um, a lot of physit, a lot of groups of physitites
611460	620740	look very similar to one another. And this is one that I seem to have several of them mixed in with
620740	630180	what I call physitites, Musadella. Um, I saved a lot of them, but I need to revisit the ones that I've
630180	638500	identified as physitites to see whether I underestimated and under-recorded Baphila,
638500	643860	which could explain why there's so many later records and so few early records.
643860	653940	It was difficult to identify even after dissecting it because it has kind of a,
656260	661940	I hate to use the word nondescript genitalia. Nondescript is an oxymoron, you know,
661940	670260	because you're using it to describe something. But, um, Bidalia, I spoke of before this feeds on
670260	681460	morning glories, including sweet potato. Uh, and, um, it's interesting because it's a tiny,
681460	687860	it's one of those tiny moths that flies in cold months as well as sporadically throughout the year.
690500	695860	Larvae are leaf miners. It may be imported. It's the, I think it's the only member of its
695860	706340	family. And, you know, because it feeds on sweet potato, maybe it was introduced with
707700	714420	some kind of sweet potato. Um, but it's widely distributed. Can,
716740	723140	when you grow sweet potatoes in a greenhouse, it can reach kind of pest status. It's a leaf miner
723140	729940	for most, it's a leaf miner that exits the leaf to make a cocoon that's in a hammock.
731300	737780	And then it turns into adults. And I think there's just one generation per year,
737780	743780	but the adults are around all year. So it could be that there's more than one generation.
743780	748260	Okay. Borkhausenia nephrax.
750580	754180	This, this is, um, a true
756660	765380	Ecophorid, Ecophorid-y, O-E, Ecophorid-y. You know, most of them were split off and put into
765380	775620	depressority. And there is a monograph. You can find out more about the life history, but I have a
775620	784180	sense that this is an occasional nuisance and maybe a pest. And whether it's native or not,
784180	792260	I can't speculate, but it may be in the monograph. You know, the earlier monographs in the Mono series are downloadable.
793780	798420	So, um, you know, we paid a fortune for them when we were younger and now they're free.
802420	805060	But everything else has gotten more expensive. So I guess it's
805060	817940	Bryotrophahajazae is one of two, this is a Gallicaid. It's one of two, um, species in our area,
817940	824020	but the other one seems to be more coastal, but they're so similar to one another that you can't
824020	829620	be absolutely sure without dissecting them. And I dissected an enormous number of them. I saved
829620	843140	every one for the longest time. And they look like many of the common, um, Gallicaids that have, um,
843860	851140	overlapping wings that are more flat rather than gable roof, not gable, but, uh, peaked roof-like.
851700	856020	So they're, so Cyanotes and Aroga and some of those other genres.
856020	864980	But it has a bristle at the base of the antenna, which you can see under high magnification
866340	873620	that allows you to identify them without, identify the genus without dissecting them. So I put a lot
873620	885780	of them aside. And during the course of this survey, these two authors described a number of new species.
886980	892340	And all the ones I described turned out to be this one species, or I dissected turned out to be this
892340	899940	one species. And it appears the other one in Northern California is coastal. So I think this is the only
899940	906340	one they have, but it's possible the other one is here. Looks like that one might cycle too, huh?
906340	912500	Pardon me? It looks like this one might be cycling. Could be. I don't know the host plant.
912500	922500	You know, with all small moths, they're easy, you know, because they're small,
923700	925460	because a number of them are internal feeders.
925460	937060	They can be easily transported, you know, and overlooked. And most of them are not pest species.
937060	943940	So it's hard to say whether they're native or non-native. But I would suspect
944740	952740	smaller moths don't seem to disperse as much as larger moths in general, but not in particular,
952740	965460	necessarily. So I would say that small moths are most small moths are probably native species.
966420	970180	Most of them are somewhat specialists.
973700	978180	But like all generalities, there are numerous exceptions.
979620	983460	And a lot of what I just said is speculation.
983460	984900	I added a lot of probabilities.
985780	990020	Do you have that paper evolution of larval food plants that Powell wrote?
990580	993060	Probably in the 70s. It was in the...
993060	995140	I'll write it down now.
995140	997540	It's called Evolution of Larval Food Plants.
999300	1000660	Of Lepidoptera, I think.
1000660	1001620	I'd like to read that.
1001620	1004820	It's in the ESA.
1006660	1008500	What's their kind of larger papers?
1011140	1012660	Ecological Entomology?
1012660	1018100	No, in the ESA, Entomological Society of America, has...
1018100	1018900	Annual review.
1019380	1019860	Pardon me?
1019860	1020740	Annual review.
1021940	1022740	Annual review.
1023620	1024820	I don't know.
1024820	1025460	Annals.
1026580	1027460	Annals of the...
1028020	1028420	Oh, okay.
1028420	1029540	Oh, did you find the paper?
1030820	1033620	I think so. Evolution of Larval Food Preferences...
1033620	1034820	Yeah, that's the paper.
1034820	1042580	And I think as an ecologist, it would be a good paper.
1043060	1044660	Could you send that to me?
1044660	1048260	And as an ecologist working on Lepidoptera, it would be a good one to have.
1049300	1050580	Yeah, we need to read that.
1050580	1050900	Yeah.
1051220	1052420	And you might be able...
1052420	1059620	If it's not downloadable, you might be able to get a copy from Pete Oboiski in the museum,
1059620	1064180	because they're kind of dealing with Jerry's artifacts.
1065700	1068580	Yeah, sometimes these older papers are available to us, and sometimes they're not.
1068580	1069700	If you go to the Moth Photographer's...
1069700	1071060	It looks like it's available.
1071380	1071700	Okay.
1072340	1073860	Yeah, there's a scan of it online.
1074260	1077620	Often, there's a direct link to it on the Moth Photographer's Group.
1077620	1078660	You just click on it.
1078660	1079140	Oh, okay.
1079140	1082100	So, on many of the papers.
1083300	1088580	But this one, because it doesn't deal with a particular moth, it may not be.
