1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
throat. Okay, we have started again. So I'm going to skip right by these, except that

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:15,500
for a species seven, I rear from that roost trilobeta, you know, the little shrubby roost

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:25,040
that's there in Cold Canyon. So I have not seen ones that look exactly like this in Davis,

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,860
but we don't have roost trilobeta. Did you rear it from a leaf or something? How'd you rear it?

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:40,920
Well, I found the larvae kind of silk-tied some leaves, but they don't make big feeding shelters

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,200
the same way that tortricids do, which are often very tightly rolled. But many Gellicheas do make

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,500
similar type of feeding structure, you know, but it varies from species to species. Some of them are

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,280
internal, some of them are flowers and so forth. But these, I'm pretty sure I just collected the

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,140
foliage because I could see leaves, silk-tied leaves. And, you know, the same is true of

10
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,460
that aprorhima on lotus. You can see the leaves tied together.

11
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:21,380
This thing that says large reddish brown, this is, I believe, a, what's the genus?

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,940
It starts with A, obviously.

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,400
Aroga or?

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,240
What is it?

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,800
A-R-O-G-A.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,940
Aroga, yes. It's an aroga.

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:39,440
Aroga, and it resembles this species here, but I don't remember what, that I put here,

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,400
aroga, but I don't remember whether it resembles it in the genitalia or in the coloration or

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,460
pattern and so forth.

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,300
You said genitalia on the note.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,260
Does it say genitalia? Okay.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,280
Okay.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
I get the truncated version.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,580
Yeah.

25
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,200
Arta epicinalis is a crambid. I don't know very much about the life history.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,580
There are similar-looking crambids, but it's not in Davis. This is very common, and, you

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,520
know, I could have confused some of the similar-looking species with Arta, and there's another species

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,420
of Arta, but I'm pretty sure this is the correct, at least one other species that's reported

29
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,020
from this area, but Jerry agrees with me that this is the correct name for it.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Aseptus. All of the Aseptus and related genera were the subject of a revision during the course

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:05,200
of this survey, and I had used specimens in the collection here as the reference for putting

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:13,840
names on them, and it turned out I was wrong in many respects, and it turned out in the

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,920
revision there were some erroneous things put there. Like they said one of the species is

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,600
a Southern California species, but it's the most common species at Davis and extends much

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,980
further north of Davis, so I don't know what's wrong. But, you know, I did some dissections.

36
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,780
A lot of the names were changed and reassigned and everything, and I straightened them out

37
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,660
as best as possible. But there were some that I couldn't identify, and they're in this

38
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,820
bionotata or adnexta, and the reason I couldn't identify them is I didn't have those specimens

39
00:03:49,820 --> 00:04:04,140
on hand anymore. I had assigned names to them based on my pre-revision concepts, and I only

40
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:14,820
then went back and entered the data for ones that I retained. So, early years, before revision,

41
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:25,700
pre-revision, there may be underrepresented here. But, except for perfumosa and one that,

42
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,200
perfumosa is the one that I was talking about that's not a Southern California species.

43
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:42,080
All of these are native. It feeds on chemise, I think, adenostoma, if I remember correctly.

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:56,740
And, um, a septus fumosus, which is very similar to it, also feeds on it. And the author of the

45
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,560
revision said that that's the species we have here. But, you know, after I dissected a number

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,020
of them, I couldn't find it until very recently I found two specimens of fumosus that fly a little

47
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:18,420
bit later than perfumosa. But, they didn't qualify for your list because I only have those two records.

48
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:34,820
Aspilla prunivora is also in Davis. And this is a occasional pest of, it's a tortricid leaf roller,

49
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,500
occasional pests and orchard crops.

50
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:53,000
All of the reported hosts, until recently, were, um, cultivated fruits, you know, like prunes and peaches

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,380
and that sort of thing. And then, there was a paper that I reviewed, um,

52
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:07,780
saying that they collected it on a native prunus. And I think that was the first published,

53
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,020
I don't know where the paper got published, the first published record or non-published record

54
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,260
of a native host. And it was collected in the Sierra. So, um,

55
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:30,980
it suggests that this is a native species that is exploiting, exploiting, uh, orchard crops.

56
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,900
And, uh, I think it has a common name, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.

57
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,660
Autographic Californica is at Davis and we discussed it earlier, but it,

58
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:52,580
it's a native species. And speaking of Bruce Hammock, you know, he was using, uh,

59
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,300
something from, he was trying to engineer something that had to do with Autographic Californica

60
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:09,220
for one of his, uh, for, uh, pesticidal usage, but I don't remember what it was. Or there was something

61
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:16,980
that I think there's a toxin that was. Okay. So it's not just a

62
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:26,820
pest species, but it's a laboratory. Do you know what its host is? Yeah, it feeds on a lot of things.

63
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:34,100
Okay. But I think the common name is alfalfa semiluper or something. Oh, okay. It's an

64
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:41,940
herbidae. Right. I remember talking about that one. Bectra veritana is in Davis feeds on sedges.

65
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,940
And it's a tortricid. Another,

66
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,900
another, a tortricid specialist looked at the array that I had here in the collection

67
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,580
and speculated that were two species. But Jerry Powell, who did describe some species

68
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,180
of Bectra, disagreed and says that they're all veritana, except for two that I got, two or three

69
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,140
that I got in Davis, but not at Cold Canyon. It looks like it might have population cycles, maybe.

70
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:28,020
Yeah, it could be. Um, under one of my trees, I have a coarse grass that, um, you know, I haven't

71
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,100
looked, but it dies back every year and it could be a sedge. But again, sedges, if they're anywhere,

72
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,940
they're going to be in that drainage ditch along, um,

73
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,220
was it not Russell, the next one, uh, the one that turns into Road 32? Covell. Covell.

74
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,500
I would think that they're in the drainage ditches that haven't been filled in of where they'd be.

75
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,820
And also West Davis Pond, which is only a block from my house. And West Davis Pond goes dry now.

76
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,820
The ditches are getting filled in, particularly now that they're developing that lot next to, uh,

77
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,820
the hospital. So, so maybe that's why these are, but one year it was particularly common and that shows

78
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:25,700
up there. But, um, um, it's never been as common at, um, at Cold Canyon. And, um,

79
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,700
you know, there I would expect that the sedges are going to be along the creek. And,

80
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,860
you know, what, so I would expect to get more of them down on the lower trail than I would on the east

81
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,700
trail. So is this one native or? Probably native. Yeah. Okay. Probably.

82
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,380
Baphila arameella. I mentioned before, this is the one, this is a physitine pyralid

83
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:11,460
that's larvae feed on scale insects. So cool. And, um, a lot of physit, a lot of groups of physitites

84
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:20,740
look very similar to one another. And this is one that I seem to have several of them mixed in with

85
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:30,180
what I call physitites, Musadella. Um, I saved a lot of them, but I need to revisit the ones that I've

86
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:38,500
identified as physitites to see whether I underestimated and under-recorded Baphila,

87
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,860
which could explain why there's so many later records and so few early records.

88
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:53,940
It was difficult to identify even after dissecting it because it has kind of a,

89
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,940
I hate to use the word nondescript genitalia. Nondescript is an oxymoron, you know,

90
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:10,260
because you're using it to describe something. But, um, Bidalia, I spoke of before this feeds on

91
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:21,460
morning glories, including sweet potato. Uh, and, um, it's interesting because it's a tiny,

92
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,860
it's one of those tiny moths that flies in cold months as well as sporadically throughout the year.

93
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,860
Larvae are leaf miners. It may be imported. It's the, I think it's the only member of its

94
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:46,340
family. And, you know, because it feeds on sweet potato, maybe it was introduced with

95
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,420
some kind of sweet potato. Um, but it's widely distributed. Can,

96
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,140
when you grow sweet potatoes in a greenhouse, it can reach kind of pest status. It's a leaf miner

97
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,940
for most, it's a leaf miner that exits the leaf to make a cocoon that's in a hammock.

98
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,780
And then it turns into adults. And I think there's just one generation per year,

99
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,780
but the adults are around all year. So it could be that there's more than one generation.

100
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,260
Okay. Borkhausenia nephrax.

101
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,180
This, this is, um, a true

102
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:45,380
Ecophorid, Ecophorid-y, O-E, Ecophorid-y. You know, most of them were split off and put into

103
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:55,620
depressority. And there is a monograph. You can find out more about the life history, but I have a

104
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:04,180
sense that this is an occasional nuisance and maybe a pest. And whether it's native or not,

105
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:12,260
I can't speculate, but it may be in the monograph. You know, the earlier monographs in the Mono series are downloadable.

106
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,420
So, um, you know, we paid a fortune for them when we were younger and now they're free.

107
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,060
But everything else has gotten more expensive. So I guess it's

108
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:37,940
Bryotrophahajazae is one of two, this is a Gallicaid. It's one of two, um, species in our area,

109
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,020
but the other one seems to be more coastal, but they're so similar to one another that you can't

110
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,620
be absolutely sure without dissecting them. And I dissected an enormous number of them. I saved

111
00:13:49,620 --> 00:14:03,140
every one for the longest time. And they look like many of the common, um, Gallicaids that have, um,

112
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:11,140
overlapping wings that are more flat rather than gable roof, not gable, but, uh, peaked roof-like.

113
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,020
So they're, so Cyanotes and Aroga and some of those other genres.

114
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:24,980
But it has a bristle at the base of the antenna, which you can see under high magnification

115
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:33,620
that allows you to identify them without, identify the genus without dissecting them. So I put a lot

116
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:45,780
of them aside. And during the course of this survey, these two authors described a number of new species.

117
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,340
And all the ones I described turned out to be this one species, or I dissected turned out to be this

118
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:59,940
one species. And it appears the other one in Northern California is coastal. So I think this is the only

119
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,340
one they have, but it's possible the other one is here. Looks like that one might cycle too, huh?

120
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,500
Pardon me? It looks like this one might be cycling. Could be. I don't know the host plant.

121
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:22,500
You know, with all small moths, they're easy, you know, because they're small,

122
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,460
because a number of them are internal feeders.

123
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:37,060
They can be easily transported, you know, and overlooked. And most of them are not pest species.

124
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,940
So it's hard to say whether they're native or non-native. But I would suspect

125
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:52,740
smaller moths don't seem to disperse as much as larger moths in general, but not in particular,

126
00:15:52,740 --> 00:16:05,460
necessarily. So I would say that small moths are most small moths are probably native species.

127
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,180
Most of them are somewhat specialists.

128
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,180
But like all generalities, there are numerous exceptions.

129
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,460
And a lot of what I just said is speculation.

130
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,900
I added a lot of probabilities.

131
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,020
Do you have that paper evolution of larval food plants that Powell wrote?

132
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,060
Probably in the 70s. It was in the...

133
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,140
I'll write it down now.

134
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,540
It's called Evolution of Larval Food Plants.

135
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,660
Of Lepidoptera, I think.

136
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,620
I'd like to read that.

137
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,820
It's in the ESA.

138
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,500
What's their kind of larger papers?

139
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,660
Ecological Entomology?

140
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,100
No, in the ESA, Entomological Society of America, has...

141
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,900
Annual review.

142
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,860
Pardon me?

143
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,740
Annual review.

144
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,740
Annual review.

145
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,820
I don't know.

146
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,460
Annals.

147
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,460
Annals of the...

148
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,420
Oh, okay.

149
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,540
Oh, did you find the paper?

150
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,620
I think so. Evolution of Larval Food Preferences...

151
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,820
Yeah, that's the paper.

152
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:22,580
And I think as an ecologist, it would be a good paper.

153
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,660
Could you send that to me?

154
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,260
And as an ecologist working on Lepidoptera, it would be a good one to have.

155
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,580
Yeah, we need to read that.

156
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah.

157
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,420
And you might be able...

158
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,620
If it's not downloadable, you might be able to get a copy from Pete Oboiski in the museum,

159
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,180
because they're kind of dealing with Jerry's artifacts.

160
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,580
Yeah, sometimes these older papers are available to us, and sometimes they're not.

161
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,700
If you go to the Moth Photographer's...

162
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,060
It looks like it's available.

163
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,700
Okay.

164
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
Yeah, there's a scan of it online.

165
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,620
Often, there's a direct link to it on the Moth Photographer's Group.

166
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,660
You just click on it.

167
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
Oh, okay.

168
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,100
So, on many of the papers.

169
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,580
But this one, because it doesn't deal with a particular moth, it may not be.
