WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.900
throat. Okay, we have started again. So I'm going to skip right by these, except that

00:06.900 --> 00:15.500
for a species seven, I rear from that roost trilobeta, you know, the little shrubby roost

00:15.500 --> 00:25.040
that's there in Cold Canyon. So I have not seen ones that look exactly like this in Davis,

00:25.040 --> 00:29.860
but we don't have roost trilobeta. Did you rear it from a leaf or something? How'd you rear it?

00:30.340 --> 00:40.920
Well, I found the larvae kind of silk-tied some leaves, but they don't make big feeding shelters

00:40.920 --> 00:48.200
the same way that tortricids do, which are often very tightly rolled. But many Gellicheas do make

00:48.200 --> 00:54.500
similar type of feeding structure, you know, but it varies from species to species. Some of them are

00:54.500 --> 00:59.280
internal, some of them are flowers and so forth. But these, I'm pretty sure I just collected the

00:59.280 --> 01:05.140
foliage because I could see leaves, silk-tied leaves. And, you know, the same is true of

01:05.140 --> 01:10.460
that aprorhima on lotus. You can see the leaves tied together.

01:10.460 --> 01:21.380
This thing that says large reddish brown, this is, I believe, a, what's the genus?

01:21.380 --> 01:24.940
It starts with A, obviously.

01:25.340 --> 01:26.400
Aroga or?

01:26.760 --> 01:27.240
What is it?

01:27.400 --> 01:28.800
A-R-O-G-A.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.940
Aroga, yes. It's an aroga.

01:30.940 --> 01:39.440
Aroga, and it resembles this species here, but I don't remember what, that I put here,

01:39.540 --> 01:46.400
aroga, but I don't remember whether it resembles it in the genitalia or in the coloration or

01:46.400 --> 01:47.460
pattern and so forth.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.300
You said genitalia on the note.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.260
Does it say genitalia? Okay.

01:51.960 --> 01:52.280
Okay.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.320
I get the truncated version.

01:54.320 --> 01:54.580
Yeah.

01:59.580 --> 02:06.200
Arta epicinalis is a crambid. I don't know very much about the life history.

02:06.200 --> 02:14.580
There are similar-looking crambids, but it's not in Davis. This is very common, and, you

02:14.580 --> 02:21.520
know, I could have confused some of the similar-looking species with Arta, and there's another species

02:21.520 --> 02:28.420
of Arta, but I'm pretty sure this is the correct, at least one other species that's reported

02:28.420 --> 02:34.020
from this area, but Jerry agrees with me that this is the correct name for it.

02:36.200 --> 02:54.080
Aseptus. All of the Aseptus and related genera were the subject of a revision during the course

02:54.080 --> 03:05.200
of this survey, and I had used specimens in the collection here as the reference for putting

03:05.200 --> 03:13.840
names on them, and it turned out I was wrong in many respects, and it turned out in the

03:13.840 --> 03:19.920
revision there were some erroneous things put there. Like they said one of the species is

03:19.920 --> 03:26.600
a Southern California species, but it's the most common species at Davis and extends much

03:26.600 --> 03:32.980
further north of Davis, so I don't know what's wrong. But, you know, I did some dissections.

03:32.980 --> 03:37.780
A lot of the names were changed and reassigned and everything, and I straightened them out

03:37.780 --> 03:43.660
as best as possible. But there were some that I couldn't identify, and they're in this

03:43.660 --> 03:49.820
bionotata or adnexta, and the reason I couldn't identify them is I didn't have those specimens

03:49.820 --> 04:04.140
on hand anymore. I had assigned names to them based on my pre-revision concepts, and I only

04:04.140 --> 04:14.820
then went back and entered the data for ones that I retained. So, early years, before revision,

04:14.820 --> 04:25.700
pre-revision, there may be underrepresented here. But, except for perfumosa and one that,

04:26.900 --> 04:31.200
perfumosa is the one that I was talking about that's not a Southern California species.

04:32.200 --> 04:42.080
All of these are native. It feeds on chemise, I think, adenostoma, if I remember correctly.

04:42.080 --> 04:56.740
And, um, a septus fumosus, which is very similar to it, also feeds on it. And the author of the

04:56.740 --> 05:02.560
revision said that that's the species we have here. But, you know, after I dissected a number

05:02.560 --> 05:10.020
of them, I couldn't find it until very recently I found two specimens of fumosus that fly a little

05:10.020 --> 05:18.420
bit later than perfumosa. But, they didn't qualify for your list because I only have those two records.

05:20.580 --> 05:34.820
Aspilla prunivora is also in Davis. And this is a occasional pest of, it's a tortricid leaf roller,

05:34.820 --> 05:38.500
occasional pests and orchard crops.

05:42.180 --> 05:53.000
All of the reported hosts, until recently, were, um, cultivated fruits, you know, like prunes and peaches

05:53.000 --> 05:59.380
and that sort of thing. And then, there was a paper that I reviewed, um,

05:59.380 --> 06:07.780
saying that they collected it on a native prunus. And I think that was the first published,

06:07.780 --> 06:14.020
I don't know where the paper got published, the first published record or non-published record

06:14.020 --> 06:20.260
of a native host. And it was collected in the Sierra. So, um,

06:20.260 --> 06:30.980
it suggests that this is a native species that is exploiting, exploiting, uh, orchard crops.

06:33.780 --> 06:38.900
And, uh, I think it has a common name, but I don't know what it is off the top of my head.

06:39.860 --> 06:44.660
Autographic Californica is at Davis and we discussed it earlier, but it,

06:44.660 --> 06:52.580
it's a native species. And speaking of Bruce Hammock, you know, he was using, uh,

06:54.100 --> 06:59.300
something from, he was trying to engineer something that had to do with Autographic Californica

07:00.420 --> 07:09.220
for one of his, uh, for, uh, pesticidal usage, but I don't remember what it was. Or there was something

07:09.220 --> 07:16.980
that I think there's a toxin that was. Okay. So it's not just a

07:19.700 --> 07:26.820
pest species, but it's a laboratory. Do you know what its host is? Yeah, it feeds on a lot of things.

07:26.820 --> 07:34.100
Okay. But I think the common name is alfalfa semiluper or something. Oh, okay. It's an

07:34.100 --> 07:41.940
herbidae. Right. I remember talking about that one. Bectra veritana is in Davis feeds on sedges.

07:46.260 --> 07:49.940
And it's a tortricid. Another,

07:52.740 --> 07:58.900
another, a tortricid specialist looked at the array that I had here in the collection

07:58.900 --> 08:04.580
and speculated that were two species. But Jerry Powell, who did describe some species

08:05.620 --> 08:12.180
of Bectra, disagreed and says that they're all veritana, except for two that I got, two or three

08:12.180 --> 08:19.140
that I got in Davis, but not at Cold Canyon. It looks like it might have population cycles, maybe.

08:19.700 --> 08:28.020
Yeah, it could be. Um, under one of my trees, I have a coarse grass that, um, you know, I haven't

08:28.020 --> 08:34.100
looked, but it dies back every year and it could be a sedge. But again, sedges, if they're anywhere,

08:34.100 --> 08:37.940
they're going to be in that drainage ditch along, um,

08:40.900 --> 08:47.220
was it not Russell, the next one, uh, the one that turns into Road 32? Covell. Covell.

08:49.060 --> 08:54.500
I would think that they're in the drainage ditches that haven't been filled in of where they'd be.

08:54.500 --> 09:00.820
And also West Davis Pond, which is only a block from my house. And West Davis Pond goes dry now.

09:00.820 --> 09:06.820
The ditches are getting filled in, particularly now that they're developing that lot next to, uh,

09:06.820 --> 09:12.820
the hospital. So, so maybe that's why these are, but one year it was particularly common and that shows

09:12.820 --> 09:25.700
up there. But, um, um, it's never been as common at, um, at Cold Canyon. And, um,

09:27.220 --> 09:31.700
you know, there I would expect that the sedges are going to be along the creek. And,

09:32.980 --> 09:39.860
you know, what, so I would expect to get more of them down on the lower trail than I would on the east

09:39.860 --> 09:45.700
trail. So is this one native or? Probably native. Yeah. Okay. Probably.

09:52.740 --> 09:59.380
Baphila arameella. I mentioned before, this is the one, this is a physitine pyralid

09:59.380 --> 10:11.460
that's larvae feed on scale insects. So cool. And, um, a lot of physit, a lot of groups of physitites

10:11.460 --> 10:20.740
look very similar to one another. And this is one that I seem to have several of them mixed in with

10:20.740 --> 10:30.180
what I call physitites, Musadella. Um, I saved a lot of them, but I need to revisit the ones that I've

10:30.180 --> 10:38.500
identified as physitites to see whether I underestimated and under-recorded Baphila,

10:38.500 --> 10:43.860
which could explain why there's so many later records and so few early records.

10:43.860 --> 10:53.940
It was difficult to identify even after dissecting it because it has kind of a,

10:56.260 --> 11:01.940
I hate to use the word nondescript genitalia. Nondescript is an oxymoron, you know,

11:01.940 --> 11:10.260
because you're using it to describe something. But, um, Bidalia, I spoke of before this feeds on

11:10.260 --> 11:21.460
morning glories, including sweet potato. Uh, and, um, it's interesting because it's a tiny,

11:21.460 --> 11:27.860
it's one of those tiny moths that flies in cold months as well as sporadically throughout the year.

11:30.500 --> 11:35.860
Larvae are leaf miners. It may be imported. It's the, I think it's the only member of its

11:35.860 --> 11:46.340
family. And, you know, because it feeds on sweet potato, maybe it was introduced with

11:47.700 --> 11:54.420
some kind of sweet potato. Um, but it's widely distributed. Can,

11:56.740 --> 12:03.140
when you grow sweet potatoes in a greenhouse, it can reach kind of pest status. It's a leaf miner

12:03.140 --> 12:09.940
for most, it's a leaf miner that exits the leaf to make a cocoon that's in a hammock.

12:11.300 --> 12:17.780
And then it turns into adults. And I think there's just one generation per year,

12:17.780 --> 12:23.780
but the adults are around all year. So it could be that there's more than one generation.

12:23.780 --> 12:28.260
Okay. Borkhausenia nephrax.

12:30.580 --> 12:34.180
This, this is, um, a true

12:36.660 --> 12:45.380
Ecophorid, Ecophorid-y, O-E, Ecophorid-y. You know, most of them were split off and put into

12:45.380 --> 12:55.620
depressority. And there is a monograph. You can find out more about the life history, but I have a

12:55.620 --> 13:04.180
sense that this is an occasional nuisance and maybe a pest. And whether it's native or not,

13:04.180 --> 13:12.260
I can't speculate, but it may be in the monograph. You know, the earlier monographs in the Mono series are downloadable.

13:13.780 --> 13:18.420
So, um, you know, we paid a fortune for them when we were younger and now they're free.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.060
But everything else has gotten more expensive. So I guess it's

13:25.060 --> 13:37.940
Bryotrophahajazae is one of two, this is a Gallicaid. It's one of two, um, species in our area,

13:37.940 --> 13:44.020
but the other one seems to be more coastal, but they're so similar to one another that you can't

13:44.020 --> 13:49.620
be absolutely sure without dissecting them. And I dissected an enormous number of them. I saved

13:49.620 --> 14:03.140
every one for the longest time. And they look like many of the common, um, Gallicaids that have, um,

14:03.860 --> 14:11.140
overlapping wings that are more flat rather than gable roof, not gable, but, uh, peaked roof-like.

14:11.700 --> 14:16.020
So they're, so Cyanotes and Aroga and some of those other genres.

14:16.020 --> 14:24.980
But it has a bristle at the base of the antenna, which you can see under high magnification

14:26.340 --> 14:33.620
that allows you to identify them without, identify the genus without dissecting them. So I put a lot

14:33.620 --> 14:45.780
of them aside. And during the course of this survey, these two authors described a number of new species.

14:46.980 --> 14:52.340
And all the ones I described turned out to be this one species, or I dissected turned out to be this

14:52.340 --> 14:59.940
one species. And it appears the other one in Northern California is coastal. So I think this is the only

14:59.940 --> 15:06.340
one they have, but it's possible the other one is here. Looks like that one might cycle too, huh?

15:06.340 --> 15:12.500
Pardon me? It looks like this one might be cycling. Could be. I don't know the host plant.

15:12.500 --> 15:22.500
You know, with all small moths, they're easy, you know, because they're small,

15:23.700 --> 15:25.460
because a number of them are internal feeders.

15:25.460 --> 15:37.060
They can be easily transported, you know, and overlooked. And most of them are not pest species.

15:37.060 --> 15:43.940
So it's hard to say whether they're native or non-native. But I would suspect

15:44.740 --> 15:52.740
smaller moths don't seem to disperse as much as larger moths in general, but not in particular,

15:52.740 --> 16:05.460
necessarily. So I would say that small moths are most small moths are probably native species.

16:06.420 --> 16:10.180
Most of them are somewhat specialists.

16:13.700 --> 16:18.180
But like all generalities, there are numerous exceptions.

16:19.620 --> 16:23.460
And a lot of what I just said is speculation.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.900
I added a lot of probabilities.

16:25.780 --> 16:30.020
Do you have that paper evolution of larval food plants that Powell wrote?

16:30.580 --> 16:33.060
Probably in the 70s. It was in the...

16:33.060 --> 16:35.140
I'll write it down now.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.540
It's called Evolution of Larval Food Plants.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.660
Of Lepidoptera, I think.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.620
I'd like to read that.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.820
It's in the ESA.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.500
What's their kind of larger papers?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.660
Ecological Entomology?

16:52.660 --> 16:58.100
No, in the ESA, Entomological Society of America, has...

16:58.100 --> 16:58.900
Annual review.

16:59.380 --> 16:59.860
Pardon me?

16:59.860 --> 17:00.740
Annual review.

17:01.940 --> 17:02.740
Annual review.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.820
I don't know.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.460
Annals.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.460
Annals of the...

17:08.020 --> 17:08.420
Oh, okay.

17:08.420 --> 17:09.540
Oh, did you find the paper?

17:10.820 --> 17:13.620
I think so. Evolution of Larval Food Preferences...

17:13.620 --> 17:14.820
Yeah, that's the paper.

17:14.820 --> 17:22.580
And I think as an ecologist, it would be a good paper.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.660
Could you send that to me?

17:24.660 --> 17:28.260
And as an ecologist working on Lepidoptera, it would be a good one to have.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.580
Yeah, we need to read that.

17:30.580 --> 17:30.900
Yeah.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.420
And you might be able...

17:32.420 --> 17:39.620
If it's not downloadable, you might be able to get a copy from Pete Oboiski in the museum,

17:39.620 --> 17:44.180
because they're kind of dealing with Jerry's artifacts.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.580
Yeah, sometimes these older papers are available to us, and sometimes they're not.

17:48.580 --> 17:49.700
If you go to the Moth Photographer's...

17:49.700 --> 17:51.060
It looks like it's available.

17:51.380 --> 17:51.700
Okay.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.860
Yeah, there's a scan of it online.

17:54.260 --> 17:57.620
Often, there's a direct link to it on the Moth Photographer's Group.

17:57.620 --> 17:58.660
You just click on it.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.140
Oh, okay.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.100
So, on many of the papers.

18:03.300 --> 18:08.580
But this one, because it doesn't deal with a particular moth, it may not be.
