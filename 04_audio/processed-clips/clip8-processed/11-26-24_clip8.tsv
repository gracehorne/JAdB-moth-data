0	6320	would necessarily have to be included in it, but you should know about it now because
6320	13080	it's kind of the whole process.
16600	19300	So the easiest thing is collecting.
20380	25460	Then you have to do the spreading and mounting and so forth.
25460	30040	So where did the names come from?
33140	39700	Major sources run as I compare them to specimens in the museum because when I first started there was
39700	47420	very few internet resources. In fact, there may not have even been an internet when I started.
47420	59420	So, you know, like Moth Photographers Group, it's slowly built up and it's fairly reliable now, but it's not perfect nor is anything else.
59420	77420	So I compared things to things in the museum here, but also I got help of a lot of experts, some of whom were advanced amateurs and others were professional entomologists.
77420	89420	The most important was Jerry Powell for the micros and many of the macros, but nobody knows Western micros better than Jerry Powell.
89420	106420	Ron Robertson, he was a teacher and had a degree in biology from Berkeley and had worked for a long time
106420	118420	as a volunteer curator at the California Academy and he had very advanced skills working with Noctuates.
118420	143300	So he especially helped with Noctuates because after he was through working at Cal Academy, he came up here to work on our collection and our collection was in pretty good shape because at least for Noctuates, we had two people who specialized in Noctuates and donated their collection here.
143300	153300	And that was Bucket and that was Bucket and you may see their names throughout the checklist.
153300	171300	And then there was a host of other people who were less, who contributed less, but the most important ones were Ron Leuchner and he had a reputation for providing erroneous names.
171300	173300	Oh no.
173300	175300	But he would always get you closer to the right answer.
175300	178300	And even the experts make mistakes.
178300	187300	You know, I find mistakes in the names I got from Ron Robertson from what I got from Jerry Powell.
187300	196300	But it's kind of a fool's errand to think that you can put the right name on everything.
196300	197300	And for various reasons.
197300	199300	One, not everything has a name.
199300	205300	And the other thing is names change all the time as concepts change.
205300	208300	So we do the best we can.
208300	218300	And so our touchstone is going to be the checklist and modifications which showed up on Mark Photographer's Group.
218300	231300	So those are the names which we'll use and we have to say probably at the end of this year we're not going to change names after this unless it's clear that they should be changed.
231300	232300	Mm-hmm.
232300	241300	But if it's just an opinion about whether something's a species or subspecies or this, that, and other things, I think it's irrelevant.
241300	247300	Because what you want to know is whether a group of specimens are all the same thing or not.
247300	248300	Yeah.
248300	249300	Yeah.
249300	264300	So you could just call them, you know, the guy who did the recovery study of large moths in the Chico area after the big fire, the Paradise Fire of some years ago.
264300	265300	Mm-hmm.
265300	268300	He didn't, he didn't bother to identify things.
268300	269300	He just said, well.
269300	270300	Group them together.
270300	273300	These seem to be all the same species.
273300	278300	And that's what he did.
278300	290300	I didn't, he, he had a poster at the Lepidopter Society meetings when it was here in Davis in 2019.
290300	295300	And because I was busy with somebody else, I didn't get a chance to see it.
295300	300300	I talked to his major professor and said, well, I can help identify specimens for them.
300300	302300	And it went nowhere.
302300	303300	He didn't contact you?
303300	304300	Yeah.
304300	305300	Oh, that's weird.
305300	313300	I don't know that he ever put names on a lot of his specimens, but he probably used moth photographers.
313300	315300	Yeah.
315300	316300	Yeah.
316300	327300	But, um, for certain groups and, you know, I'll mention that, you know, this is a difficult group when we get to various genera.
327300	328300	Yeah.
328300	332300	Um, cool.
332300	338300	So yeah, so yeah, like pretty much you, you went to experts when there was an expert in a group.
338300	344300	That's the, that's part of the process.
344300	358300	The other is if there are reliable illustrations of genitalia, I'll do dissections if it will help me clarify or confirm identifications.
358300	365300	But it's kind of a waste of time for me to do it if I don't have anything to compare it with.
365300	376300	And just by sheer coincidence, I decided that I would dissect Stamnotes because I wasn't sure how many species we had.
376300	383300	And I couldn't tell by looking at museum specimens what we had.
383300	390300	And Wagner just shortly afterwards had a student and who decided to work on Stamnotes.
390300	393300	So that's getting clarified now.
393300	394300	Perfect.
394300	401300	But I dissected them all and determined that we did have the species that I thought we had,
401300	409300	plus some that were hard to distinguish from some of the ones that we have.
409300	420300	But Bill Patterson, who, you know, collected at Quail Ridge and only used external characters to identify his moth,
420300	423300	he pretty much had everything right, so.
423300	424300	Oh, that's interesting.
424300	425300	It turns out.
425300	428300	So he didn't do any dissections and he still pretty much had it?
428300	432300	No, he's, I tried to train him one time, but he decided he couldn't do it.
432300	437300	You know, there's a limit to how many small moths he can dissect.
437300	444300	And recently I got an email from him and he said that he's having trouble spreading anything now.
444300	451300	He's 85, so his eyesight's bad.
451300	454300	He said because of his eyesight he can't spread anymore.
454300	458300	But he's just kind of stepping back from the hobby.
458300	463300	He donated all of his moths sometime to the collection here
463300	470300	and has kept his butterfly collection and maybe a few, oh my moths, I don't know.
470300	473300	So do you want to start on this before Emily gets here or do you want to wait?
473300	475300	We can, yeah.
475300	476300	Whatever you want to do.
476300	480300	If you think it would be prudent to wait for her.
480300	482300	I mean, she gets your notes anyway.
482300	483300	Yeah, so.
483300	485300	And we will be going over.
485300	486300	Cold Canyon.
486300	487300	And then later on.
487300	488300	Yes.
488300	491300	And so it'll be a second chance to talk about some of these.
491300	492300	Exactly.
492300	493300	Yeah.
493300	495300	So if we, we left off at the O's.
495300	496300	At O's?
496300	497300	Yeah.
497300	498300	Oh.
498300	499300	Yeah.
499300	500300	Oh.
500300	501300	Okay.
501300	504300	Even if it's not human enough there.
504300	505300	We did monfa.
505300	506300	We did.
506300	508300	Did we do pneumophila?
508300	509300	Mm-hmm.
509300	510300	Okay.
510300	521300	Oh, backtracking to Noctua pro nuva.
521300	526300	There's another species which like Noctua was introduced from Europe.
526300	531300	And all the records were kind of in British Columbia for a while.
531300	534300	But now I see that it's reached Southern Oregon.
534300	539300	And it's quite similar with a yellow-orange hindwing.
539300	546300	But it has a dot in the middle of the central area of the hindwing that is absent on it.
546300	549300	And it's smaller and the wings are stubbier, so.
549300	551300	Is it the same genus?
551300	553300	Same genus, Noctua.
553300	554300	Hi, John.
554300	555300	Hi.
555300	556300	Hi, Grace.
556300	557300	Sorry that I'm late.
557300	558300	I had to shift this into the two.
558300	559300	I'm leaving my voice, so I don't know how long I'll last today.
559300	560300	That's okay.
560300	561300	Okay.
561300	563300	It's okay with you, but it's not okay.
563300	564300	I'm sorry.
564300	565300	Yeah.
565300	567300	I said, it's just as long as you're comfortable.
567300	569300	And he said, well, I'll go home then.
573300	577300	I'm blaming it on the cortisone shot from the back out of my knees.
577300	579300	Does it feel better?
579300	580300	It's just the same.
580300	581300	I'm sorry.
581300	586300	But it's hard to tell because it may take a while and it's only been a few days.
586300	601300	And if there's anything, it seems that there's not persistent pain like there was if I did
601300	604300	something that put a lot of stress on my knee.
604300	611300	So what I'm hoping to do is to be able to take long walks once again.
611300	613300	And I haven't tested that yet.
613300	615300	That's quite a part of my quality of life too.
615300	616300	I understand that.
616300	617300	Where are we?
617300	619300	We're starting with the O's.
619300	620300	Yes.
620300	623300	And the first one that I have here is Eagle Coney and Nova Mundi.
623300	624300	Thank you.
624300	625300	Same here.
629300	631300	Oh, Eagle Coney.
631300	632300	It's over here.
632300	633300	It should be anyway.
633300	634300	It looks like it's not here.
634300	637300	Oh, I don't have very many from Cold Canyon.
637300	647300	Eagle Coney and Nova Mundi was known as Eagle Coney Quadramaculata for a long time.
647300	654300	And somebody did some DNA studies, a guy in Canada, and found out that we have two species,
654300	658300	neither one of which was Quadramaculata.
658300	666300	And all of them look practically identical if you look only at the pattern.
666300	675300	And the genitalia were eventually, illustrations of the genitalia were eventually posted online.
675300	679300	So I did quite a few dissections last year.
679300	687300	And it turned out that all that I dissected are Nova Mundi, which is what I've been recording them at.
687300	700300	But there's a possibility that this second species, the name of which isn't popping into my head right now, is also in the mix.
700300	702300	You're recording audio, right, Grace?
702300	703300	Yes.
703300	704300	Yes.
704300	714300	And whether this, the old name, Quadramaculata, is an old world species.
714300	719300	And these are probably new world species that nobody knows.
719300	727300	Why don't you take notes and I'll take care of Skipper.
727300	734300	So your analysis seems to show that it's increasing, but it had a very poor year this year.
734300	740300	No, actually the red means that even though we see an increase, it's just, it only looks that way because of collection.
740300	744300	This year seemed notable decline this year.
744300	745300	That's good.
745300	746300	Okay.
746300	747300	So we have to write down that.
747300	753300	So today was in line with what your model suggests.
753300	754300	That's promising.
754300	763300	Enophila viflava is an introduced species and it feeds on mold and so forth.
763300	774300	So if you have house plants and you get like leaf litter or even the potted lamps that have mold in them.
774300	779300	So you get this tiny moth flying around your house and it's almost always Enophila viflava.
779300	790300	And it's seen more often in houses than it is outdoors, but I get it fairly common outdoors.
790300	797300	But, you know, it's so small that it's a moth that most moth collectors would not, would ignore.
797300	803300	They might see it or they might not see it, but they'd ignore it because I can't spread that anyway.
803300	817300	You know, so Greg, for example, never reports it from his yard, but he brought one in once that somebody had found in the house and was worried that this was some kind of horrible species.
817300	822300	But at worst, it's probably eating mold on potted plants.
822300	835300	Opagona omoscopa disappeared all of a sudden about two or three years ago and you show it on an increase.
835300	838300	Well, it does look like it's declined in recent years.
838300	844300	But it totally disappeared after a high of 121 years, which is...
844300	851300	How are you getting these nonlinear patterns? Is it because you have additional variables in your model?
851300	856300	I don't think we can detect the nonlinear trends.
856300	860300	Oh, because you're... I'm sorry, John, we have to take a modeling detour.
860300	863300	That's one of the reasons why I was thinking about the splines, because...
863300	865300	Well, it shows that it's increasing, but...
865300	870300	Your model still predicts things really well, even when the trends are nonlinear. How is it doing that?
870300	877300	Well, you're analyzing the available data and it shows a trend, but the trend, all of a sudden, it just crashed and disappeared.
877300	881300	Do you know how it's doing that?
881300	882300	Um...
882300	883300	I would write down to look that up.
883300	884300	Yeah.
884300	889300	Like, how is your model predicting things so well if the only relationships we're allowing it to have are linear?
889300	894300	It might just be because you have covariance and then the output is a certain...
894300	898300	That would be my suspicion, but I don't fully know, so I'd have to look at that.
898300	904300	We're going to figure that out, because it does look like there's sort of a hump shape there.
904300	905300	Yeah.
905300	917300	Now, I know that when Felix Sperling was at Berkeley, he's a Canadian, and went back to Canada because he didn't like it here.
917300	921300	It was too expensive and too dangerous, he thought, to live in Berkeley.
921300	923300	He has a point.
923300	927300	He told me at the time that he was running a light on the balcony.
927300	932300	You know, he lived in a UC condo, a faculty condo.
932300	936300	And he told me that he was getting a lot of this smoth in Berkeley, too.
936300	941300	And I never got it at Cold Canyon, so it may be more of a domestic...
941300	944300	Do you think it's native or non-native? Do you know?
944300	947300	I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.
947300	949300	The problem with these...
949300	955300	This is kind of a scavenger and probably feeds on fungus or mold.
955300	968300	It's hard to know where they originated because they move around on any type of wood product or, you know, vegetable material.
968300	970300	They can eat pretty much anything, so yeah.
970300	972300	Yeah, okay.
972300	983300	Opagona species one is not for certain it's Opagona, but one of the people who identified Mothsbury,
983300	991300	and the one who's been unreliable, saw specimens that Berkeley had of this moth,
991300	997300	and it showed up in Berkeley about the same time as here, and said that that was an Opagona.
997300	1010300	And it looks kind of like Opagona, and there's one that recently was introduced called the Banana Moth, and I don't know what the species is, but this could be the Banana Moth.
1010300	1015300	Why it's called the Banana Moth, I don't know, except that it might have been first discovered in...
1015300	1019300	It kind of looks like a banana.
1019300	1021300	That looks like a banana?
1021300	1022300	That's not...
1022300	1023300	That's not what it looks like.
1023300	1024300	Oh, I see.
1024300	1025300	Okay.
1025300	1027300	Is that more what it looks like?
1027300	1030300	No, you need to look at Opagona, the...
1030300	1031300	This one.
1031300	1032300	That's not what it looks like.
1032300	1034300	That's the one that it might be.
1034300	1035300	That doesn't look so much like that.
1035300	1040300	And Moth Photographers Group has some pictures of it.
1040300	1042300	It's kind of a...
1042300	1044300	It looks very different.
1044300	1056300	This one is quite variable in size, which is often the case with moths that are scavengers because food quality kind of comes and goes.
1056300	1057300	That's interesting.
1057300	1070300	So, for example, there's a tinea that Don Strong has been working at, and it gets into coyote scats and then goes down into the soil.
1070300	1085300	And I knew it from San Bruno Mountain where I collected owl pellets, and it also gets into owl pellets, so it eats keratinaceous substances.
1085300	1095300	And I had reared it in a bag for a long, long time, and over time it got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.
1095300	1100300	So, Jerry put that in his book after I made some comments.
1100300	1105300	Okay, so Opagona is probably Opagona.
1105300	1107300	It's a recent arrival.
1107300	1115300	It was in lower numbers this year than previous years.
1115300	1125300	You don't have the 2024 data, and I don't know whether you want it or not, but it's nearly complete now if you do want it.
1125300	1130300	I think we do want it, but we want it for maybe an update to the database.
1130300	1131300	Yeah.
1131300	1132300	Yeah.
1132300	1133300	You want it?
1133300	1134300	I'm sorry, I didn't hear.
1134300	1135300	As an update later on.
1135300	1136300	Okay.
1136300	1139300	I think for 2023 is where we stopped for our analysis.
1139300	1144300	Yeah, you don't have the 2024 data, so you couldn't have analyzed it.
1144300	1145300	Right.
1145300	1150300	But I have now dissected almost everything that I intend to dissect.
1150300	1158300	And I'm also dissecting some older material for confirmation because I didn't get around it.
1158300	1171300	That means that I have very few of the UFOs, you know, my UFO, that are still UFOs.
1171300	1172300	That's great.
1172300	1173300	Yeah.
1173300	1174300	It's still cheaper.
1174300	1175300	Most of the ones.
1175300	1176300	Yeah.
1176300	1181300	There are some that I have not yet integrated into the collection, but I'm almost through.
1181300	1183300	It's only like...
1183300	1184300	Yeah.
1184300	1185300	Yeah.
1185300	1186300	Orthonema obstipata.
1186300	1187300	Yeah.
1187300	1188300	Oh, you don't need any of that.
1188300	1191300	It's right there.
1191300	1196300	And another moth that we've previously discussed.
1196300	1199300	They have costa convexa centra stragaria.
1199300	1201300	They have one in Davis, too.
1201300	1207300	There's one form of orthonema that's very distinct from the others, but the other ones,
1207300	1211300	if you don't have them side by side, they're kind of hard to tell apart.
1211300	1213300	They were like, we have one in Davis, too.
1213300	1214300	And centra stragaria.
1214300	1223300	You know, Wagner looked at someone, he was visiting me on one of his visits, and he said
1223300	1228300	he didn't think it was centra stragaria, but I think there's just geographic variation.
1228300	1229300	Yes.
1229300	1236300	But it may turn out that that one turns out to be a different species than eastern ones.
1236300	1243300	And I think both of these are fairly widespread and probably native, but I don't know for sure.
1243300	1249300	Orthosia hibisca is a winter bath.
1249300	1256300	So the fact that there's more of them in the later years may be due to more collection dates in the later years.
1256300	1257300	Okay.
1257300	1259300	And we didn't identify a trend, so that's good.
1259300	1260300	We did in this one.
1260300	1261300	Really interesting.
1261300	1262300	Okay.
1262300	1275300	Orthosia in general, there's some species that are hard to tell apart from one another.
1275300	1293300	And the character which I've been using to differentiate a couple of these difficult species does not seem to hold up if the pictures posted on the internet are correctly identified.
1293300	1304300	So the problem is I don't have any genitalic drawings or illustrations or photographs to compare them to.
1304300	1314300	But that seems to be the most common orthosia in Davis.
1314300	1315300	Pyromyzen.
1315300	1316300	Pyromyzen.
1316300	1326300	Wagner told me recently that there was a monograph on pyro and all of the western species couldn't be differentiated from one another.
1326300	1327300	Did I skip some?
1327300	1328300	Yes.
1328300	1329300	Okay.
1329300	1331300	Okay, that's backtrack.
1331300	1335300	Per abogrotus formalis.
1335300	1341300	There's at least three species of per abogrotus in Davis.
1341300	1348300	Formalis, Insularis, and much rarer Cupididissima.
1348300	1358300	Per abogrotus formalis, as I mentioned before, looks a little bit like a delphagrotus indeterminata.
1358300	1372300	And before I realized that there was as many species as we have, I recorded everything as still a different species called Exerta Stigma.
1372300	1378300	And at that time it was in a different genus.
1378300	1390300	And Exerta Stigma is reported from around here and using the characters which says that, so ones that appear to be that species I've dissected.
1390300	1399300	And they've all turned out to be Formalis or Insularis.
1399300	1402300	So I don't think that species is here.
1402300	1404300	I think it's a coastal species.
1404300	1408300	It looks like they're doing better over time in Cold Canyon.
1408300	1411300	Is that, do you feel like that's consistent?
1411300	1413300	Could be, yeah.
1413300	1415300	I think it's a generalist.
1415300	1417300	I think they're native.
1417300	1422300	They do show up around the year, throughout the year.
1422300	1432300	We don't have data for the early years except for any specimens that I retained before I learned how to tell them apart.
1432300	1440300	Once I learned how to tell them apart, I went back and identified any of the specimens that I retained.
1440300	1449300	But those were mostly from Cold Canyon because I think by the time I was doing it at Davis, they were resolved but I'm not sure.
1449300	1458300	I don't remember when that monograph came out that enabled me to straighten things up.
1458300	1462300	Insularis can be confused.
1462300	1468300	Para abogrodus, adelphagrodus and abogrodus
1468300	1469300	All the grodi.
1469300	1472300	Are somewhat similar to one another.
1472300	1481300	And, you know, if you work with them for a long time and never leave, you can recognize them on sight.
1481300	1486300	But when you only look at them occasionally, it's hard.
1486300	1495300	So I do have dissected specimens of the species in those genera that I use as references.
1495300	1499300	And if I'm not clear which species it is, I'll dissect them.
1499300	1504300	Because the genitalia illustrate photographs that are available.
1506300	1508300	I'm going to start a new...
