WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
would necessarily have to be included in it, but you should know about it now because

00:06.320 --> 00:13.080
it's kind of the whole process.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.300
So the easiest thing is collecting.

00:20.380 --> 00:25.460
Then you have to do the spreading and mounting and so forth.

00:25.460 --> 00:30.040
So where did the names come from?

00:33.140 --> 00:39.700
Major sources run as I compare them to specimens in the museum because when I first started there was

00:39.700 --> 00:47.420
very few internet resources. In fact, there may not have even been an internet when I started.

00:47.420 --> 00:59.420
So, you know, like Moth Photographers Group, it's slowly built up and it's fairly reliable now, but it's not perfect nor is anything else.

00:59.420 --> 01:17.420
So I compared things to things in the museum here, but also I got help of a lot of experts, some of whom were advanced amateurs and others were professional entomologists.

01:17.420 --> 01:29.420
The most important was Jerry Powell for the micros and many of the macros, but nobody knows Western micros better than Jerry Powell.

01:29.420 --> 01:46.420
Ron Robertson, he was a teacher and had a degree in biology from Berkeley and had worked for a long time

01:46.420 --> 01:58.420
as a volunteer curator at the California Academy and he had very advanced skills working with Noctuates.

01:58.420 --> 02:23.300
So he especially helped with Noctuates because after he was through working at Cal Academy, he came up here to work on our collection and our collection was in pretty good shape because at least for Noctuates, we had two people who specialized in Noctuates and donated their collection here.

02:23.300 --> 02:33.300
And that was Bucket and that was Bucket and you may see their names throughout the checklist.

02:33.300 --> 02:51.300
And then there was a host of other people who were less, who contributed less, but the most important ones were Ron Leuchner and he had a reputation for providing erroneous names.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.300
Oh no.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.300
But he would always get you closer to the right answer.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.300
And even the experts make mistakes.

02:58.300 --> 03:07.300
You know, I find mistakes in the names I got from Ron Robertson from what I got from Jerry Powell.

03:07.300 --> 03:16.300
But it's kind of a fool's errand to think that you can put the right name on everything.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.300
And for various reasons.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.300
One, not everything has a name.

03:19.300 --> 03:25.300
And the other thing is names change all the time as concepts change.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.300
So we do the best we can.

03:28.300 --> 03:38.300
And so our touchstone is going to be the checklist and modifications which showed up on Mark Photographer's Group.

03:38.300 --> 03:51.300
So those are the names which we'll use and we have to say probably at the end of this year we're not going to change names after this unless it's clear that they should be changed.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.300
Mm-hmm.

03:52.300 --> 04:01.300
But if it's just an opinion about whether something's a species or subspecies or this, that, and other things, I think it's irrelevant.

04:01.300 --> 04:07.300
Because what you want to know is whether a group of specimens are all the same thing or not.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.300
Yeah.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.300
Yeah.

04:09.300 --> 04:24.300
So you could just call them, you know, the guy who did the recovery study of large moths in the Chico area after the big fire, the Paradise Fire of some years ago.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.300
Mm-hmm.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.300
He didn't, he didn't bother to identify things.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.300
He just said, well.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.300
Group them together.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.300
These seem to be all the same species.

04:33.300 --> 04:38.300
And that's what he did.

04:38.300 --> 04:50.300
I didn't, he, he had a poster at the Lepidopter Society meetings when it was here in Davis in 2019.

04:50.300 --> 04:55.300
And because I was busy with somebody else, I didn't get a chance to see it.

04:55.300 --> 05:00.300
I talked to his major professor and said, well, I can help identify specimens for them.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.300
And it went nowhere.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.300
He didn't contact you?

05:03.300 --> 05:04.300
Yeah.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.300
Oh, that's weird.

05:05.300 --> 05:13.300
I don't know that he ever put names on a lot of his specimens, but he probably used moth photographers.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.300
Yeah.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.300
Yeah.

05:16.300 --> 05:27.300
But, um, for certain groups and, you know, I'll mention that, you know, this is a difficult group when we get to various genera.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.300
Yeah.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.300
Um, cool.

05:32.300 --> 05:38.300
So yeah, so yeah, like pretty much you, you went to experts when there was an expert in a group.

05:38.300 --> 05:44.300
That's the, that's part of the process.

05:44.300 --> 05:58.300
The other is if there are reliable illustrations of genitalia, I'll do dissections if it will help me clarify or confirm identifications.

05:58.300 --> 06:05.300
But it's kind of a waste of time for me to do it if I don't have anything to compare it with.

06:05.300 --> 06:16.300
And just by sheer coincidence, I decided that I would dissect Stamnotes because I wasn't sure how many species we had.

06:16.300 --> 06:23.300
And I couldn't tell by looking at museum specimens what we had.

06:23.300 --> 06:30.300
And Wagner just shortly afterwards had a student and who decided to work on Stamnotes.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.300
So that's getting clarified now.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.300
Perfect.

06:34.300 --> 06:41.300
But I dissected them all and determined that we did have the species that I thought we had,

06:41.300 --> 06:49.300
plus some that were hard to distinguish from some of the ones that we have.

06:49.300 --> 07:00.300
But Bill Patterson, who, you know, collected at Quail Ridge and only used external characters to identify his moth,

07:00.300 --> 07:03.300
he pretty much had everything right, so.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.300
Oh, that's interesting.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
It turns out.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.300
So he didn't do any dissections and he still pretty much had it?

07:08.300 --> 07:12.300
No, he's, I tried to train him one time, but he decided he couldn't do it.

07:12.300 --> 07:17.300
You know, there's a limit to how many small moths he can dissect.

07:17.300 --> 07:24.300
And recently I got an email from him and he said that he's having trouble spreading anything now.

07:24.300 --> 07:31.300
He's 85, so his eyesight's bad.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.300
He said because of his eyesight he can't spread anymore.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.300
But he's just kind of stepping back from the hobby.

07:38.300 --> 07:43.300
He donated all of his moths sometime to the collection here

07:43.300 --> 07:50.300
and has kept his butterfly collection and maybe a few, oh my moths, I don't know.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.300
So do you want to start on this before Emily gets here or do you want to wait?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.300
We can, yeah.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.300
Whatever you want to do.

07:56.300 --> 08:00.300
If you think it would be prudent to wait for her.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.300
I mean, she gets your notes anyway.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.300
Yeah, so.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
And we will be going over.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.300
Cold Canyon.

08:06.300 --> 08:07.300
And then later on.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.300
Yes.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.300
And so it'll be a second chance to talk about some of these.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.300
Exactly.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.300
Yeah.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.300
So if we, we left off at the O's.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
At O's?

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
Yeah.

08:17.300 --> 08:18.300
Oh.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.300
Yeah.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
Oh.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.300
Okay.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.300
Even if it's not human enough there.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.300
We did monfa.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.300
We did.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.300
Did we do pneumophila?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
Mm-hmm.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.300
Okay.

08:30.300 --> 08:41.300
Oh, backtracking to Noctua pro nuva.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.300
There's another species which like Noctua was introduced from Europe.

08:46.300 --> 08:51.300
And all the records were kind of in British Columbia for a while.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.300
But now I see that it's reached Southern Oregon.

08:54.300 --> 08:59.300
And it's quite similar with a yellow-orange hindwing.

08:59.300 --> 09:06.300
But it has a dot in the middle of the central area of the hindwing that is absent on it.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.300
And it's smaller and the wings are stubbier, so.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.300
Is it the same genus?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.300
Same genus, Noctua.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.300
Hi, John.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.300
Hi.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.300
Hi, Grace.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.300
Sorry that I'm late.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.300
I had to shift this into the two.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.300
I'm leaving my voice, so I don't know how long I'll last today.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.300
That's okay.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.300
Okay.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.300
It's okay with you, but it's not okay.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.300
I'm sorry.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.300
Yeah.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.300
I said, it's just as long as you're comfortable.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.300
And he said, well, I'll go home then.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.300
I'm blaming it on the cortisone shot from the back out of my knees.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.300
Does it feel better?

09:39.300 --> 09:40.300
It's just the same.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.300
I'm sorry.

09:41.300 --> 09:46.300
But it's hard to tell because it may take a while and it's only been a few days.

09:46.300 --> 10:01.300
And if there's anything, it seems that there's not persistent pain like there was if I did

10:01.300 --> 10:04.300
something that put a lot of stress on my knee.

10:04.300 --> 10:11.300
So what I'm hoping to do is to be able to take long walks once again.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.300
And I haven't tested that yet.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.300
That's quite a part of my quality of life too.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
I understand that.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.300
Where are we?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
We're starting with the O's.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.300
Yes.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.300
And the first one that I have here is Eagle Coney and Nova Mundi.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.300
Thank you.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.300
Same here.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.300
Oh, Eagle Coney.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.300
It's over here.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.300
It should be anyway.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.300
It looks like it's not here.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.300
Oh, I don't have very many from Cold Canyon.

10:37.300 --> 10:47.300
Eagle Coney and Nova Mundi was known as Eagle Coney Quadramaculata for a long time.

10:47.300 --> 10:54.300
And somebody did some DNA studies, a guy in Canada, and found out that we have two species,

10:54.300 --> 10:58.300
neither one of which was Quadramaculata.

10:58.300 --> 11:06.300
And all of them look practically identical if you look only at the pattern.

11:06.300 --> 11:15.300
And the genitalia were eventually, illustrations of the genitalia were eventually posted online.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.300
So I did quite a few dissections last year.

11:19.300 --> 11:27.300
And it turned out that all that I dissected are Nova Mundi, which is what I've been recording them at.

11:27.300 --> 11:40.300
But there's a possibility that this second species, the name of which isn't popping into my head right now, is also in the mix.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
You're recording audio, right, Grace?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.300
Yes.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.300
Yes.

11:44.300 --> 11:54.300
And whether this, the old name, Quadramaculata, is an old world species.

11:54.300 --> 11:59.300
And these are probably new world species that nobody knows.

11:59.300 --> 12:07.300
Why don't you take notes and I'll take care of Skipper.

12:07.300 --> 12:14.300
So your analysis seems to show that it's increasing, but it had a very poor year this year.

12:14.300 --> 12:20.300
No, actually the red means that even though we see an increase, it's just, it only looks that way because of collection.

12:20.300 --> 12:24.300
This year seemed notable decline this year.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.300
That's good.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
Okay.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.300
So we have to write down that.

12:27.300 --> 12:33.300
So today was in line with what your model suggests.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.300
That's promising.

12:34.300 --> 12:43.300
Enophila viflava is an introduced species and it feeds on mold and so forth.

12:43.300 --> 12:54.300
So if you have house plants and you get like leaf litter or even the potted lamps that have mold in them.

12:54.300 --> 12:59.300
So you get this tiny moth flying around your house and it's almost always Enophila viflava.

12:59.300 --> 13:10.300
And it's seen more often in houses than it is outdoors, but I get it fairly common outdoors.

13:10.300 --> 13:17.300
But, you know, it's so small that it's a moth that most moth collectors would not, would ignore.

13:17.300 --> 13:23.300
They might see it or they might not see it, but they'd ignore it because I can't spread that anyway.

13:23.300 --> 13:37.300
You know, so Greg, for example, never reports it from his yard, but he brought one in once that somebody had found in the house and was worried that this was some kind of horrible species.

13:37.300 --> 13:42.300
But at worst, it's probably eating mold on potted plants.

13:42.300 --> 13:55.300
Opagona omoscopa disappeared all of a sudden about two or three years ago and you show it on an increase.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.300
Well, it does look like it's declined in recent years.

13:58.300 --> 14:04.300
But it totally disappeared after a high of 121 years, which is...

14:04.300 --> 14:11.300
How are you getting these nonlinear patterns? Is it because you have additional variables in your model?

14:11.300 --> 14:16.300
I don't think we can detect the nonlinear trends.

14:16.300 --> 14:20.300
Oh, because you're... I'm sorry, John, we have to take a modeling detour.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.300
That's one of the reasons why I was thinking about the splines, because...

14:23.300 --> 14:25.300
Well, it shows that it's increasing, but...

14:25.300 --> 14:30.300
Your model still predicts things really well, even when the trends are nonlinear. How is it doing that?

14:30.300 --> 14:37.300
Well, you're analyzing the available data and it shows a trend, but the trend, all of a sudden, it just crashed and disappeared.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.300
Do you know how it's doing that?

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
Um...

14:42.300 --> 14:43.300
I would write down to look that up.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.300
Yeah.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.300
Like, how is your model predicting things so well if the only relationships we're allowing it to have are linear?

14:49.300 --> 14:54.300
It might just be because you have covariance and then the output is a certain...

14:54.300 --> 14:58.300
That would be my suspicion, but I don't fully know, so I'd have to look at that.

14:58.300 --> 15:04.300
We're going to figure that out, because it does look like there's sort of a hump shape there.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.300
Yeah.

15:05.300 --> 15:17.300
Now, I know that when Felix Sperling was at Berkeley, he's a Canadian, and went back to Canada because he didn't like it here.

15:17.300 --> 15:21.300
It was too expensive and too dangerous, he thought, to live in Berkeley.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.300
He has a point.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.300
He told me at the time that he was running a light on the balcony.

15:27.300 --> 15:32.300
You know, he lived in a UC condo, a faculty condo.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.300
And he told me that he was getting a lot of this smoth in Berkeley, too.

15:36.300 --> 15:41.300
And I never got it at Cold Canyon, so it may be more of a domestic...

15:41.300 --> 15:44.300
Do you think it's native or non-native? Do you know?

15:44.300 --> 15:47.300
I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
The problem with these...

15:49.300 --> 15:55.300
This is kind of a scavenger and probably feeds on fungus or mold.

15:55.300 --> 16:08.300
It's hard to know where they originated because they move around on any type of wood product or, you know, vegetable material.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.300
They can eat pretty much anything, so yeah.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.300
Yeah, okay.

16:12.300 --> 16:23.300
Opagona species one is not for certain it's Opagona, but one of the people who identified Mothsbury,

16:23.300 --> 16:31.300
and the one who's been unreliable, saw specimens that Berkeley had of this moth,

16:31.300 --> 16:37.300
and it showed up in Berkeley about the same time as here, and said that that was an Opagona.

16:37.300 --> 16:50.300
And it looks kind of like Opagona, and there's one that recently was introduced called the Banana Moth, and I don't know what the species is, but this could be the Banana Moth.

16:50.300 --> 16:55.300
Why it's called the Banana Moth, I don't know, except that it might have been first discovered in...

16:55.300 --> 16:59.300
It kind of looks like a banana.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.300
That looks like a banana?

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
That's not...

17:02.300 --> 17:03.300
That's not what it looks like.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.300
Oh, I see.

17:04.300 --> 17:05.300
Okay.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.300
Is that more what it looks like?

17:07.300 --> 17:10.300
No, you need to look at Opagona, the...

17:10.300 --> 17:11.300
This one.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.300
That's not what it looks like.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.300
That's the one that it might be.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.300
That doesn't look so much like that.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.300
And Moth Photographers Group has some pictures of it.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.300
It's kind of a...

17:22.300 --> 17:24.300
It looks very different.

17:24.300 --> 17:36.300
This one is quite variable in size, which is often the case with moths that are scavengers because food quality kind of comes and goes.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
That's interesting.

17:37.300 --> 17:50.300
So, for example, there's a tinea that Don Strong has been working at, and it gets into coyote scats and then goes down into the soil.

17:50.300 --> 18:05.300
And I knew it from San Bruno Mountain where I collected owl pellets, and it also gets into owl pellets, so it eats keratinaceous substances.

18:05.300 --> 18:15.300
And I had reared it in a bag for a long, long time, and over time it got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

18:15.300 --> 18:20.300
So, Jerry put that in his book after I made some comments.

18:20.300 --> 18:25.300
Okay, so Opagona is probably Opagona.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.300
It's a recent arrival.

18:27.300 --> 18:35.300
It was in lower numbers this year than previous years.

18:35.300 --> 18:45.300
You don't have the 2024 data, and I don't know whether you want it or not, but it's nearly complete now if you do want it.

18:45.300 --> 18:50.300
I think we do want it, but we want it for maybe an update to the database.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.300
Yeah.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.300
Yeah.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.300
You want it?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.300
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.300
As an update later on.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.300
Okay.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.300
I think for 2023 is where we stopped for our analysis.

18:59.300 --> 19:04.300
Yeah, you don't have the 2024 data, so you couldn't have analyzed it.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.300
Right.

19:05.300 --> 19:10.300
But I have now dissected almost everything that I intend to dissect.

19:10.300 --> 19:18.300
And I'm also dissecting some older material for confirmation because I didn't get around it.

19:18.300 --> 19:31.300
That means that I have very few of the UFOs, you know, my UFO, that are still UFOs.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.300
That's great.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.300
Yeah.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.300
It's still cheaper.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.300
Most of the ones.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.300
Yeah.

19:36.300 --> 19:41.300
There are some that I have not yet integrated into the collection, but I'm almost through.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
It's only like...

19:43.300 --> 19:44.300
Yeah.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
Yeah.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.300
Orthonema obstipata.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.300
Yeah.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
Oh, you don't need any of that.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.300
It's right there.

19:51.300 --> 19:56.300
And another moth that we've previously discussed.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.300
They have costa convexa centra stragaria.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.300
They have one in Davis, too.

20:01.300 --> 20:07.300
There's one form of orthonema that's very distinct from the others, but the other ones,

20:07.300 --> 20:11.300
if you don't have them side by side, they're kind of hard to tell apart.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.300
They were like, we have one in Davis, too.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.300
And centra stragaria.

20:14.300 --> 20:23.300
You know, Wagner looked at someone, he was visiting me on one of his visits, and he said

20:23.300 --> 20:28.300
he didn't think it was centra stragaria, but I think there's just geographic variation.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.300
Yes.

20:29.300 --> 20:36.300
But it may turn out that that one turns out to be a different species than eastern ones.

20:36.300 --> 20:43.300
And I think both of these are fairly widespread and probably native, but I don't know for sure.

20:43.300 --> 20:49.300
Orthosia hibisca is a winter bath.

20:49.300 --> 20:56.300
So the fact that there's more of them in the later years may be due to more collection dates in the later years.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.300
Okay.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.300
And we didn't identify a trend, so that's good.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.300
We did in this one.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.300
Really interesting.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.300
Okay.

21:02.300 --> 21:15.300
Orthosia in general, there's some species that are hard to tell apart from one another.

21:15.300 --> 21:33.300
And the character which I've been using to differentiate a couple of these difficult species does not seem to hold up if the pictures posted on the internet are correctly identified.

21:33.300 --> 21:44.300
So the problem is I don't have any genitalic drawings or illustrations or photographs to compare them to.

21:44.300 --> 21:54.300
But that seems to be the most common orthosia in Davis.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.300
Pyromyzen.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.300
Pyromyzen.

21:56.300 --> 22:06.300
Wagner told me recently that there was a monograph on pyro and all of the western species couldn't be differentiated from one another.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.300
Did I skip some?

22:07.300 --> 22:08.300
Yes.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.300
Okay.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.300
Okay, that's backtrack.

22:11.300 --> 22:15.300
Per abogrotus formalis.

22:15.300 --> 22:21.300
There's at least three species of per abogrotus in Davis.

22:21.300 --> 22:28.300
Formalis, Insularis, and much rarer Cupididissima.

22:28.300 --> 22:38.300
Per abogrotus formalis, as I mentioned before, looks a little bit like a delphagrotus indeterminata.

22:38.300 --> 22:52.300
And before I realized that there was as many species as we have, I recorded everything as still a different species called Exerta Stigma.

22:52.300 --> 22:58.300
And at that time it was in a different genus.

22:58.300 --> 23:10.300
And Exerta Stigma is reported from around here and using the characters which says that, so ones that appear to be that species I've dissected.

23:10.300 --> 23:19.300
And they've all turned out to be Formalis or Insularis.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.300
So I don't think that species is here.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.300
I think it's a coastal species.

23:24.300 --> 23:28.300
It looks like they're doing better over time in Cold Canyon.

23:28.300 --> 23:31.300
Is that, do you feel like that's consistent?

23:31.300 --> 23:33.300
Could be, yeah.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.300
I think it's a generalist.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
I think they're native.

23:37.300 --> 23:42.300
They do show up around the year, throughout the year.

23:42.300 --> 23:52.300
We don't have data for the early years except for any specimens that I retained before I learned how to tell them apart.

23:52.300 --> 24:00.300
Once I learned how to tell them apart, I went back and identified any of the specimens that I retained.

24:00.300 --> 24:09.300
But those were mostly from Cold Canyon because I think by the time I was doing it at Davis, they were resolved but I'm not sure.

24:09.300 --> 24:18.300
I don't remember when that monograph came out that enabled me to straighten things up.

24:18.300 --> 24:22.300
Insularis can be confused.

24:22.300 --> 24:28.300
Para abogrodus, adelphagrodus and abogrodus

24:28.300 --> 24:29.300
All the grodi.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.300
Are somewhat similar to one another.

24:32.300 --> 24:41.300
And, you know, if you work with them for a long time and never leave, you can recognize them on sight.

24:41.300 --> 24:46.300
But when you only look at them occasionally, it's hard.

24:46.300 --> 24:55.300
So I do have dissected specimens of the species in those genera that I use as references.

24:55.300 --> 24:59.300
And if I'm not clear which species it is, I'll dissect them.

24:59.300 --> 25:04.300
Because the genitalia illustrate photographs that are available.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.300
I'm going to start a new...
