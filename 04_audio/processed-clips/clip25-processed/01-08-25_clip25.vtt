WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Are you good to go?

00:04.360 --> 00:04.540
Mm-hmm.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.620
Okay, Nematicampa bremiata.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.740
Uh-oh. Okay, we're good.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.500
It's a geometrid, distinct, so all should be recorded.

00:21.900 --> 00:26.940
Nemoria, there's three species listed here, and those are the green geometrids.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.000
I love those ones.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.500
Over there, brother.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.140
Darwiniata has a similar-looking species.

00:38.620 --> 00:42.660
They fly at different times of the year, called Glaucomarginaria,

00:42.860 --> 00:44.440
and I've only got that a few times.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.860
And Wagner likes this group.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.540
He's trying to get larvae for them.

00:48.540 --> 00:55.200
And he tells me that Polcorrhima, which is the third species listed here,

00:56.360 --> 00:58.660
is more than one species.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
And along the coast, you get some that aren't green.

01:04.120 --> 01:09.260
They're kind of reddish, but you get both green ones mixed in with the brownish-red ones.

01:09.260 --> 01:17.060
So I think he's basing that decision on having done some DNA on them, but I don't know.

01:17.060 --> 01:27.820
So what I've listed here is Polcorrhima, or one species, but it might not be Polcorrhima in the future.

01:27.820 --> 01:36.240
And it's the one that flies earliest in the year, so it's a winter, early spring moth.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.980
So you can miss it some years if you don't have collection days.

01:40.980 --> 01:47.020
It's Neo-Alsis, California area, another geometrid.

01:49.020 --> 01:52.980
It has kind of square-looking...

01:52.980 --> 01:55.980
Yeah, there are, but I'm not in there.

01:55.980 --> 02:05.240
So it can be confused with other species, but because it flies at a different time of the year than the ones that it's similar to...

02:05.240 --> 02:08.240
I believe they're all recorded correctly.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.700
It's a variable moth.

02:10.800 --> 02:20.360
But, you know, browns and grays and blacks, so it's not particularly memorable.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.740
Yes, I would say...

02:22.740 --> 02:24.920
Noctua pronuba, we've discussed.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.420
It showed up in our area in 2002, so it's not here in the early years.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.620
Noa minna is a noad.

02:40.700 --> 02:41.980
Fairly distinct.

02:41.980 --> 02:44.040
I think there's another species.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.400
Well, there's meganoa, and then one other.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.400
There's, there are in different genera, so.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.480
I believe all are recorded correctly.

02:55.480 --> 03:00.280
I don't know what the food plant is, but it's probably known if you do a search.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.400
Noamania duodecim lineata.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.700
Recently, generic change.

03:07.700 --> 03:14.900
It's a small geometra that feeds on oaks and common in the early months of the year.

03:15.940 --> 03:18.200
Sometimes, some years more common than others.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.500
Noamania piercellae, same genus as the larger moth.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.400
And, um...

03:32.400 --> 03:39.400
Quite different from duodecim lineata in the pattern, but similar to some other species.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.360
Nictiola cenariana is a...

03:44.360 --> 03:46.840
I don't know what.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.160
That's all I'm going to say.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.280
Orgaea vitusta.

03:54.280 --> 04:05.480
There were two species in the monograph, which was one of the early monographs, you know, from back in the 70s, or maybe even before that.

04:06.280 --> 04:13.980
And vitusta and another species were differentiated by having bulging eyes or not having bulging eyes.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.680
And now those two species have been synonymized.

04:18.680 --> 04:27.880
And I think vitusta is the best name for what the very common tussock moth is in our area.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.880
So, that's family Lyman treidae.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.880
Orthonaema obstipata, I talked about in Davis.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.880
Orthosia.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.880
There's several species of orthosia.

04:43.880 --> 04:54.880
Orthosia ortholitis, with an A, is the only species that flies in our area in the fall to early winter.

04:54.880 --> 05:04.880
All the other ones, they may emerge in late fall to early winter, but they fly later than ortholita.

05:04.880 --> 05:14.880
And I don't know, I think all of these feed on trees and shrubs, but I don't know too much about it.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
Berenziana.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.880
I'm trying to see what's there.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.880
Berenziana and I think it's Pacifica.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Berenza.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
Berenziana.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
Berenziana.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
Which is interesting now.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Berenziana.

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
Berenziana.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.880
Berenziana.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
Berenziana.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
Berenziana.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
Berenziana.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
Berenziana.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
Berenziana.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
Berenziana.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
Berenziana.

05:48.880 --> 05:49.880
Berenziana.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
Berenziana.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Berenziana.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
Berenziana.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
Berenziana.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.920
Berenziana.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.880
Berenziana.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
Berenziana.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
Berenziana.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.920
Berenziana.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
Berenziana.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
Berenziana.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.920
Berenziana.

06:02.920 --> 06:03.920
Berenziana.

06:03.920 --> 06:10.720
very late in the end of the year and then continues into the beginning months of the next year.

06:16.560 --> 06:22.680
Pacifica, I mentioned before, pre-seas is one that's variable, but it has a distinct

06:22.680 --> 06:27.660
color of a different color, so it's easy to recognize.

06:27.660 --> 06:34.300
There's one that's not listed here called Transparence. It looks like another species

06:34.300 --> 06:40.140
which has been recorded from McLaughlin and Quail Ridge, but I never saw it at Cold Canyon,

06:40.140 --> 06:48.360
so there's potential for another Orthosia here. It's one that I would like to see a monograph on

06:48.360 --> 06:56.780
because they're kind of confusing. Per abogrodus unidentified. This is a listing for early

06:56.780 --> 07:04.300
specimens that I didn't retain because later what we had been calling Rhynchogrodus exertus stigma

07:05.420 --> 07:10.700
was separated into several different species.

07:12.860 --> 07:20.620
Some were raised out of synonyms. So early moths that I didn't retain I couldn't identify, but the early

07:20.620 --> 07:28.220
moths that I did retain were either Formalis or Insularis. And I talked about these then in

07:29.420 --> 07:32.300
Davis and the same situation was true in Davis.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.740
Pila Christa canana was listed under several names

07:41.740 --> 07:49.340
and it is a tortricid, an Olathrutine tortricid. I don't know what it feeds on,

07:53.180 --> 08:00.540
but variable enough so that Powell gave me several names for it. But there was a monograph recently that

08:01.900 --> 08:10.140
clarified the situation and I've been using the name for all the ones in this group of species.

08:10.140 --> 08:20.140
I think it feeds on sage, but I'm not certain about that. The hard desert types of sages and not the,

08:22.220 --> 08:25.020
you know, soft-leafed ones.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.140
Gotcha.

08:26.140 --> 08:36.940
Pila Christa Ibarata feeds in the roots of, in the root crown of coyote bush.

08:36.940 --> 08:43.740
Pila Christa and it's occasionally in Davis. This went blank. Does that mean anything or?

08:44.860 --> 08:46.780
Uh, nope. We're still good. We're still recording.

08:46.780 --> 08:48.540
Okay. Power save mode.

08:48.540 --> 08:49.020
Yeah, exactly.

08:49.020 --> 08:49.500
Yeah, exactly.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.380
Paradromus sages in Davis. We talked about it.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.740
Paragonica. I've recorded two species there.

08:57.740 --> 09:06.860
Polkmaier has been using different names for at least one of them, and I think both of them.

09:07.580 --> 09:14.060
One of them, the male has serrate antennae, and then the other species, the male has filiform antennae.

09:14.060 --> 09:24.300
And the females all have filiform antennae, so I kind of match the females up to the males and

09:25.100 --> 09:30.540
assign them to these different names. But there could be more species, and these names may not be

09:30.540 --> 09:43.900
correct. And it could be that some individuals were identified incorrectly. It could be that all of

09:43.900 --> 09:50.700
them are identified. But it could be that some female tertia are actually female angelata in the

09:50.700 --> 09:52.700
way that I'm using it, and vice versa.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.900
Pyromycin.

09:58.300 --> 10:03.260
I mentioned this before. Wagner thinks that the western species are all occidentalists,

10:04.060 --> 10:13.580
and the late flying ones are a bit smaller and darker than the early flying ones. So there's a gen,

10:13.580 --> 10:20.380
there are generations, and they're slightly different in coloration. And I think this variability

10:20.380 --> 10:27.420
is why there's too many names. But the, there was a monograph on Pyro, and they couldn't

10:28.940 --> 10:34.380
differentiate the western species on the basis of genitalia. And it may be because they're just one

10:34.380 --> 10:35.340
variable species.

10:38.300 --> 10:45.980
Petrophila halus callus, or Confus salus. These are the ones that I could, before I knew how to separate

10:45.980 --> 10:54.140
the two species, this is where I put the ones that I didn't retain, that I didn't identify.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.780
And there seems to be about equally abundant.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.860
And I talked about those previously.

11:04.860 --> 11:09.340
Although it looks like Confus salus.

11:10.780 --> 11:11.740
Didn't make the list.

11:11.740 --> 11:16.300
Didn't make the list. So I guess Halley's callus is more

11:18.380 --> 11:22.700
common that, or maybe they both didn't make, oh here it is.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.900
It's more common there.

11:25.900 --> 11:36.780
Farinay sub-punctata. Farinay is a fairly large genus. And over the years, I was given several

11:36.780 --> 11:44.140
different names for them, all of which are plausible. They're difficult to identify. And I haven't bothered

11:44.140 --> 11:51.020
to dissect them because I have no illustrations to separate them. But I've saved quite a few of them. But

11:51.980 --> 12:03.100
I suspect there's at least two species and possibly more. And many are reported from this area.

12:06.540 --> 12:16.460
Phygalia plumogeraria feeds on adenostoma. The female is flightless. It's just a big,

12:16.460 --> 12:28.140
big blob. And the males have extremely plumocentani, very feathery looking. And they fly early in the year.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.420
And the females, of course, don't fly at all.

12:31.420 --> 12:44.460
Phobolosia amphracta is a kind of attractive looking noctuaid, or a rivet, I guess. And

12:44.460 --> 12:52.860
so all of them would have been recorded. And because it's kind of a spiffy looking species,

12:52.860 --> 12:57.580
I have a tendency to collect most of the ones that come to the sheep.

12:57.580 --> 13:10.140
Okay, this one here should read Phobos or Telethusia. The caption is partly obscured on the printout.

13:10.140 --> 13:20.380
Yeah. And as you saw in that, I started to identify some of the unidentified specimens that I retained.

13:20.380 --> 13:31.180
And the ones that I didn't identify, I think, are a mixture of Phobos and Sertus and maybe a few Telethusia.

13:31.180 --> 13:37.740
But I think Telethusia is fairly uncommon at the Culp Canyon.

13:37.740 --> 13:45.100
But I think this was mostly early specimens that I didn't identify.

13:45.900 --> 13:51.980
Once I dissected enough of them, I could see subtle differences between the species.

13:51.980 --> 13:56.860
And one or two of them are easy to identify. The other one's not so easy.

13:57.740 --> 14:02.620
But we seem to have all the Phobos species there are known at Culp Canyon.

14:02.620 --> 14:15.340
The Physetodes musidela we discussed. But I think that I have included in here some specimens of Baphyla aramiata.

14:16.940 --> 14:22.700
Because there's more variability in the specimens I retained than there should be.

14:25.420 --> 14:29.820
And I mentioned that before, that Baphyla is similar.

14:29.820 --> 14:38.220
And Baphyla is the one that feeds on scales. And Physetodes feeds on, it's known to feed on

14:39.900 --> 14:45.420
seeds of composites, flower heads of composites. Probably feeds on other things as well.

14:48.460 --> 14:54.060
Philodesma americana is a Lyman triad.

14:54.060 --> 15:04.860
And there was some confusion about the names, but in the checklist, the ones that it was confused with is now synonymized.

15:06.300 --> 15:06.860
That's good.

15:06.860 --> 15:08.380
That solved that problem.

15:10.780 --> 15:15.180
Frutella xylastella is diamondback moth, and you know, that's everywhere.

15:15.180 --> 15:19.980
But there are similar looking species that could be confused with it.

15:21.180 --> 15:28.460
I don't believe that I've confused it with it, but there's always a possibility

15:31.100 --> 15:31.740
to tell it.

15:31.740 --> 15:41.020
Frutella xylastella is a geometrid in Davis as well, feeds on coyote bush.

15:41.660 --> 15:49.500
And there was an Australian here who was investigating it as a candidate for biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia.

15:49.500 --> 16:09.500
Frutella xylastella is common, easily identified, but does look a little bit like suffusive.

16:09.500 --> 16:17.020
But if you see them side by side, you know they're different species.

16:17.020 --> 16:20.700
Frutella xylastella is different.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.060
This is a gray species.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.180
The other two are brown.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.540
These are all Nocturids.

16:26.540 --> 16:41.100
Procerpinus lucidus is a sphinged, flies in the winter,

16:43.340 --> 16:50.140
has very green to greenish forewings and orange hindwing, very distinctive moth.

16:50.140 --> 16:57.820
It was, for years, a collector's prize because people didn't know that it flew in the winter.

16:58.380 --> 17:05.020
But once they figured out that it flew in the winter, they collected a lot of them.

17:05.020 --> 17:10.220
Females seldom come to light, so almost all the specimens in collections are males.

17:11.180 --> 17:14.700
But as it happened, the first one I ever got was a female.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.740
And there's protangery.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.580
The males fly earlier than the females.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.780
And they disappeared for a long time.

17:22.780 --> 17:28.300
And then the last year that I was there, I got two specimens.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.380
So they're not gone.

17:30.380 --> 17:35.500
I just, I think they have population cycles.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.060
And they feed on...

17:43.580 --> 17:45.020
Oh, what's the family?

17:45.020 --> 17:45.980
Oh, you can look it up.

17:51.580 --> 17:54.220
Proxenus mendara, we talked about before.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.660
There could be two species.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.660
I don't, I don't know.

17:58.940 --> 18:03.180
The males are supposed, of these two species, mendara and miranda.

18:03.980 --> 18:10.300
And as you'll notice, those are anagrams of one another, which they sometimes do when you have similar species.

18:12.300 --> 18:19.260
The males have different antennae, but I don't know what they're supposed to look like.

18:19.260 --> 18:28.140
So I've called them, um, mendara because that was the name that Ron Robertson gave me.

18:28.140 --> 18:36.060
But he kind of shrugged and said, mendara, I guess, but it flies over a long period of time and

18:38.540 --> 18:42.060
seems to have big fluctuations in abundance.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.460
I'm going to pause the recording.

18:44.460 --> 18:44.700
Okay.
