0	4180	Are you good to go?
4360	4540	Mm-hmm.
4900	8620	Okay, Nematicampa bremiata.
9200	10740	Uh-oh. Okay, we're good.
11900	17500	It's a geometrid, distinct, so all should be recorded.
21900	26940	Nemoria, there's three species listed here, and those are the green geometrids.
27080	28000	I love those ones.
30000	30500	Over there, brother.
35340	38140	Darwiniata has a similar-looking species.
38620	42660	They fly at different times of the year, called Glaucomarginaria,
42860	44440	and I've only got that a few times.
45380	46860	And Wagner likes this group.
46960	48540	He's trying to get larvae for them.
48540	55200	And he tells me that Polcorrhima, which is the third species listed here,
56360	58660	is more than one species.
60000	64000	And along the coast, you get some that aren't green.
64120	69260	They're kind of reddish, but you get both green ones mixed in with the brownish-red ones.
69260	77060	So I think he's basing that decision on having done some DNA on them, but I don't know.
77060	87820	So what I've listed here is Polcorrhima, or one species, but it might not be Polcorrhima in the future.
87820	96240	And it's the one that flies earliest in the year, so it's a winter, early spring moth.
97240	100980	So you can miss it some years if you don't have collection days.
100980	107020	It's Neo-Alsis, California area, another geometrid.
109020	112980	It has kind of square-looking...
112980	115980	Yeah, there are, but I'm not in there.
115980	125240	So it can be confused with other species, but because it flies at a different time of the year than the ones that it's similar to...
125240	128240	I believe they're all recorded correctly.
128400	129700	It's a variable moth.
130800	140360	But, you know, browns and grays and blacks, so it's not particularly memorable.
140360	142740	Yes, I would say...
142740	144920	Noctua pronuba, we've discussed.
145120	149420	It showed up in our area in 2002, so it's not here in the early years.
153420	155620	Noa minna is a noad.
160700	161980	Fairly distinct.
161980	164040	I think there's another species.
164920	168400	Well, there's meganoa, and then one other.
168400	170400	There's, there are in different genera, so.
173320	175480	I believe all are recorded correctly.
175480	180280	I don't know what the food plant is, but it's probably known if you do a search.
182760	185400	Noamania duodecim lineata.
185640	187700	Recently, generic change.
187700	194900	It's a small geometra that feeds on oaks and common in the early months of the year.
195940	198200	Sometimes, some years more common than others.
198400	203500	Noamania piercellae, same genus as the larger moth.
205360	206400	And, um...
212400	219400	Quite different from duodecim lineata in the pattern, but similar to some other species.
219400	224360	Nictiola cenariana is a...
224360	226840	I don't know what.
231000	232160	That's all I'm going to say.
232560	234280	Orgaea vitusta.
234280	245480	There were two species in the monograph, which was one of the early monographs, you know, from back in the 70s, or maybe even before that.
246280	253980	And vitusta and another species were differentiated by having bulging eyes or not having bulging eyes.
253980	258680	And now those two species have been synonymized.
258680	267880	And I think vitusta is the best name for what the very common tussock moth is in our area.
267880	269880	So, that's family Lyman treidae.
273880	276880	Orthonaema obstipata, I talked about in Davis.
280880	281880	Orthosia.
281880	283880	There's several species of orthosia.
283880	294880	Orthosia ortholitis, with an A, is the only species that flies in our area in the fall to early winter.
294880	304880	All the other ones, they may emerge in late fall to early winter, but they fly later than ortholita.
304880	314880	And I don't know, I think all of these feed on trees and shrubs, but I don't know too much about it.
315880	316880	Berenziana.
327880	329880	I'm trying to see what's there.
330880	333880	Berenziana and I think it's Pacifica.
334880	335880	Berenza.
335880	336880	Berenziana.
336880	337880	Berenziana.
337880	338880	Which is interesting now.
338880	339880	Berenziana.
339880	340880	Berenziana.
340880	341880	Berenziana.
341880	342880	Berenziana.
342880	343880	Berenziana.
343880	344880	Berenziana.
344880	345880	Berenziana.
345880	346880	Berenziana.
346880	347880	Berenziana.
347880	348880	Berenziana.
348880	349880	Berenziana.
349880	350880	Berenziana.
350880	351880	Berenziana.
351880	352880	Berenziana.
352880	353880	Berenziana.
353880	354920	Berenziana.
354920	356880	Berenziana.
356880	357880	Berenziana.
357880	358880	Berenziana.
358880	359920	Berenziana.
359920	360920	Berenziana.
360920	361920	Berenziana.
361920	362920	Berenziana.
362920	363920	Berenziana.
363920	370720	very late in the end of the year and then continues into the beginning months of the next year.
376560	382680	Pacifica, I mentioned before, pre-seas is one that's variable, but it has a distinct
382680	387660	color of a different color, so it's easy to recognize.
387660	394300	There's one that's not listed here called Transparence. It looks like another species
394300	400140	which has been recorded from McLaughlin and Quail Ridge, but I never saw it at Cold Canyon,
400140	408360	so there's potential for another Orthosia here. It's one that I would like to see a monograph on
408360	416780	because they're kind of confusing. Per abogrodus unidentified. This is a listing for early
416780	424300	specimens that I didn't retain because later what we had been calling Rhynchogrodus exertus stigma
425420	430700	was separated into several different species.
432860	440620	Some were raised out of synonyms. So early moths that I didn't retain I couldn't identify, but the early
440620	448220	moths that I did retain were either Formalis or Insularis. And I talked about these then in
449420	452300	Davis and the same situation was true in Davis.
457180	461740	Pila Christa canana was listed under several names
461740	469340	and it is a tortricid, an Olathrutine tortricid. I don't know what it feeds on,
473180	480540	but variable enough so that Powell gave me several names for it. But there was a monograph recently that
481900	490140	clarified the situation and I've been using the name for all the ones in this group of species.
490140	500140	I think it feeds on sage, but I'm not certain about that. The hard desert types of sages and not the,
502220	505020	you know, soft-leafed ones.
505020	506140	Gotcha.
506140	516940	Pila Christa Ibarata feeds in the roots of, in the root crown of coyote bush.
516940	523740	Pila Christa and it's occasionally in Davis. This went blank. Does that mean anything or?
524860	526780	Uh, nope. We're still good. We're still recording.
526780	528540	Okay. Power save mode.
528540	529020	Yeah, exactly.
529020	529500	Yeah, exactly.
529500	532380	Paradromus sages in Davis. We talked about it.
535020	537740	Paragonica. I've recorded two species there.
537740	546860	Polkmaier has been using different names for at least one of them, and I think both of them.
547580	554060	One of them, the male has serrate antennae, and then the other species, the male has filiform antennae.
554060	564300	And the females all have filiform antennae, so I kind of match the females up to the males and
565100	570540	assign them to these different names. But there could be more species, and these names may not be
570540	583900	correct. And it could be that some individuals were identified incorrectly. It could be that all of
583900	590700	them are identified. But it could be that some female tertia are actually female angelata in the
590700	592700	way that I'm using it, and vice versa.
594700	595900	Pyromycin.
598300	603260	I mentioned this before. Wagner thinks that the western species are all occidentalists,
604060	613580	and the late flying ones are a bit smaller and darker than the early flying ones. So there's a gen,
613580	620380	there are generations, and they're slightly different in coloration. And I think this variability
620380	627420	is why there's too many names. But the, there was a monograph on Pyro, and they couldn't
628940	634380	differentiate the western species on the basis of genitalia. And it may be because they're just one
634380	635340	variable species.
638300	645980	Petrophila halus callus, or Confus salus. These are the ones that I could, before I knew how to separate
645980	654140	the two species, this is where I put the ones that I didn't retain, that I didn't identify.
655420	658780	And there seems to be about equally abundant.
662300	664860	And I talked about those previously.
664860	669340	Although it looks like Confus salus.
670780	671740	Didn't make the list.
671740	676300	Didn't make the list. So I guess Halley's callus is more
678380	682700	common that, or maybe they both didn't make, oh here it is.
684620	685900	It's more common there.
685900	696780	Farinay sub-punctata. Farinay is a fairly large genus. And over the years, I was given several
696780	704140	different names for them, all of which are plausible. They're difficult to identify. And I haven't bothered
704140	711020	to dissect them because I have no illustrations to separate them. But I've saved quite a few of them. But
711980	723100	I suspect there's at least two species and possibly more. And many are reported from this area.
726540	736460	Phygalia plumogeraria feeds on adenostoma. The female is flightless. It's just a big,
736460	748140	big blob. And the males have extremely plumocentani, very feathery looking. And they fly early in the year.
749340	751420	And the females, of course, don't fly at all.
751420	764460	Phobolosia amphracta is a kind of attractive looking noctuaid, or a rivet, I guess. And
764460	772860	so all of them would have been recorded. And because it's kind of a spiffy looking species,
772860	777580	I have a tendency to collect most of the ones that come to the sheep.
777580	790140	Okay, this one here should read Phobos or Telethusia. The caption is partly obscured on the printout.
790140	800380	Yeah. And as you saw in that, I started to identify some of the unidentified specimens that I retained.
800380	811180	And the ones that I didn't identify, I think, are a mixture of Phobos and Sertus and maybe a few Telethusia.
811180	817740	But I think Telethusia is fairly uncommon at the Culp Canyon.
817740	825100	But I think this was mostly early specimens that I didn't identify.
825900	831980	Once I dissected enough of them, I could see subtle differences between the species.
831980	836860	And one or two of them are easy to identify. The other one's not so easy.
837740	842620	But we seem to have all the Phobos species there are known at Culp Canyon.
842620	855340	The Physetodes musidela we discussed. But I think that I have included in here some specimens of Baphyla aramiata.
856940	862700	Because there's more variability in the specimens I retained than there should be.
865420	869820	And I mentioned that before, that Baphyla is similar.
869820	878220	And Baphyla is the one that feeds on scales. And Physetodes feeds on, it's known to feed on
879900	885420	seeds of composites, flower heads of composites. Probably feeds on other things as well.
888460	894060	Philodesma americana is a Lyman triad.
894060	904860	And there was some confusion about the names, but in the checklist, the ones that it was confused with is now synonymized.
906300	906860	That's good.
906860	908380	That solved that problem.
910780	915180	Frutella xylastella is diamondback moth, and you know, that's everywhere.
915180	919980	But there are similar looking species that could be confused with it.
921180	928460	I don't believe that I've confused it with it, but there's always a possibility
931100	931740	to tell it.
931740	941020	Frutella xylastella is a geometrid in Davis as well, feeds on coyote bush.
941660	949500	And there was an Australian here who was investigating it as a candidate for biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia.
949500	969500	Frutella xylastella is common, easily identified, but does look a little bit like suffusive.
969500	977020	But if you see them side by side, you know they're different species.
977020	980700	Frutella xylastella is different.
980700	982060	This is a gray species.
982060	983180	The other two are brown.
984140	986540	These are all Nocturids.
986540	1001100	Procerpinus lucidus is a sphinged, flies in the winter,
1003340	1010140	has very green to greenish forewings and orange hindwing, very distinctive moth.
1010140	1017820	It was, for years, a collector's prize because people didn't know that it flew in the winter.
1018380	1025020	But once they figured out that it flew in the winter, they collected a lot of them.
1025020	1030220	Females seldom come to light, so almost all the specimens in collections are males.
1031180	1034700	But as it happened, the first one I ever got was a female.
1035260	1037740	And there's protangery.
1037740	1039580	The males fly earlier than the females.
1040780	1042780	And they disappeared for a long time.
1042780	1048300	And then the last year that I was there, I got two specimens.
1048300	1050380	So they're not gone.
1050380	1055500	I just, I think they have population cycles.
1056780	1058060	And they feed on...
1063580	1065020	Oh, what's the family?
1065020	1065980	Oh, you can look it up.
1071580	1074220	Proxenus mendara, we talked about before.
1074220	1075660	There could be two species.
1075660	1077660	I don't, I don't know.
1078940	1083180	The males are supposed, of these two species, mendara and miranda.
1083980	1090300	And as you'll notice, those are anagrams of one another, which they sometimes do when you have similar species.
1092300	1099260	The males have different antennae, but I don't know what they're supposed to look like.
1099260	1108140	So I've called them, um, mendara because that was the name that Ron Robertson gave me.
1108140	1116060	But he kind of shrugged and said, mendara, I guess, but it flies over a long period of time and
1118540	1122060	seems to have big fluctuations in abundance.
1122060	1124460	I'm going to pause the recording.
1124460	1124700	Okay.
