1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Are you good to go?

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,540
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,620
Okay, Nematicampa bremiata.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,740
Uh-oh. Okay, we're good.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,500
It's a geometrid, distinct, so all should be recorded.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,940
Nemoria, there's three species listed here, and those are the green geometrids.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,000
I love those ones.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Over there, brother.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,140
Darwiniata has a similar-looking species.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,660
They fly at different times of the year, called Glaucomarginaria,

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,440
and I've only got that a few times.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,860
And Wagner likes this group.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,540
He's trying to get larvae for them.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,200
And he tells me that Polcorrhima, which is the third species listed here,

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,660
is more than one species.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And along the coast, you get some that aren't green.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,260
They're kind of reddish, but you get both green ones mixed in with the brownish-red ones.

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:17,060
So I think he's basing that decision on having done some DNA on them, but I don't know.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:27,820
So what I've listed here is Polcorrhima, or one species, but it might not be Polcorrhima in the future.

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:36,240
And it's the one that flies earliest in the year, so it's a winter, early spring moth.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,980
So you can miss it some years if you don't have collection days.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,020
It's Neo-Alsis, California area, another geometrid.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,980
It has kind of square-looking...

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,980
Yeah, there are, but I'm not in there.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:05,240
So it can be confused with other species, but because it flies at a different time of the year than the ones that it's similar to...

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,240
I believe they're all recorded correctly.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,700
It's a variable moth.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:20,360
But, you know, browns and grays and blacks, so it's not particularly memorable.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,740
Yes, I would say...

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,920
Noctua pronuba, we've discussed.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,420
It showed up in our area in 2002, so it's not here in the early years.

32
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,620
Noa minna is a noad.

33
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,980
Fairly distinct.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,040
I think there's another species.

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, there's meganoa, and then one other.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
There's, there are in different genera, so.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,480
I believe all are recorded correctly.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,280
I don't know what the food plant is, but it's probably known if you do a search.

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,400
Noamania duodecim lineata.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,700
Recently, generic change.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,900
It's a small geometra that feeds on oaks and common in the early months of the year.

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,200
Sometimes, some years more common than others.

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Noamania piercellae, same genus as the larger moth.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
And, um...

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Quite different from duodecim lineata in the pattern, but similar to some other species.

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,360
Nictiola cenariana is a...

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,840
I don't know what.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
That's all I'm going to say.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,280
Orgaea vitusta.

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:05,480
There were two species in the monograph, which was one of the early monographs, you know, from back in the 70s, or maybe even before that.

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,980
And vitusta and another species were differentiated by having bulging eyes or not having bulging eyes.

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,680
And now those two species have been synonymized.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:27,880
And I think vitusta is the best name for what the very common tussock moth is in our area.

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
So, that's family Lyman treidae.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Orthonaema obstipata, I talked about in Davis.

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Orthosia.

57
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
There's several species of orthosia.

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Orthosia ortholitis, with an A, is the only species that flies in our area in the fall to early winter.

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:04,880
All the other ones, they may emerge in late fall to early winter, but they fly later than ortholita.

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:14,880
And I don't know, I think all of these feed on trees and shrubs, but I don't know too much about it.

61
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Berenziana.

62
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm trying to see what's there.

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Berenziana and I think it's Pacifica.

64
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Berenza.

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Berenziana.

66
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Berenziana.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Which is interesting now.

68
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Berenziana.

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Berenziana.

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Berenziana.

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Berenziana.

72
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Berenziana.

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Berenziana.

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Berenziana.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Berenziana.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Berenziana.

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Berenziana.

78
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Berenziana.

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Berenziana.

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Berenziana.

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Berenziana.

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Berenziana.

83
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Berenziana.

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,880
Berenziana.

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Berenziana.

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Berenziana.

87
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
Berenziana.

88
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Berenziana.

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Berenziana.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Berenziana.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Berenziana.

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,720
very late in the end of the year and then continues into the beginning months of the next year.

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Pacifica, I mentioned before, pre-seas is one that's variable, but it has a distinct

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,660
color of a different color, so it's easy to recognize.

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,300
There's one that's not listed here called Transparence. It looks like another species

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,140
which has been recorded from McLaughlin and Quail Ridge, but I never saw it at Cold Canyon,

97
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:48,360
so there's potential for another Orthosia here. It's one that I would like to see a monograph on

98
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,780
because they're kind of confusing. Per abogrodus unidentified. This is a listing for early

99
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,300
specimens that I didn't retain because later what we had been calling Rhynchogrodus exertus stigma

100
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,700
was separated into several different species.

101
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:20,620
Some were raised out of synonyms. So early moths that I didn't retain I couldn't identify, but the early

102
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:28,220
moths that I did retain were either Formalis or Insularis. And I talked about these then in

103
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,300
Davis and the same situation was true in Davis.

104
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,740
Pila Christa canana was listed under several names

105
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,340
and it is a tortricid, an Olathrutine tortricid. I don't know what it feeds on,

106
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,540
but variable enough so that Powell gave me several names for it. But there was a monograph recently that

107
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:10,140
clarified the situation and I've been using the name for all the ones in this group of species.

108
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:20,140
I think it feeds on sage, but I'm not certain about that. The hard desert types of sages and not the,

109
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,020
you know, soft-leafed ones.

110
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,140
Gotcha.

111
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:36,940
Pila Christa Ibarata feeds in the roots of, in the root crown of coyote bush.

112
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,740
Pila Christa and it's occasionally in Davis. This went blank. Does that mean anything or?

113
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,780
Uh, nope. We're still good. We're still recording.

114
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,540
Okay. Power save mode.

115
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,020
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,500
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,380
Paradromus sages in Davis. We talked about it.

118
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,740
Paragonica. I've recorded two species there.

119
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:06,860
Polkmaier has been using different names for at least one of them, and I think both of them.

120
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:14,060
One of them, the male has serrate antennae, and then the other species, the male has filiform antennae.

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:24,300
And the females all have filiform antennae, so I kind of match the females up to the males and

122
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,540
assign them to these different names. But there could be more species, and these names may not be

123
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:43,900
correct. And it could be that some individuals were identified incorrectly. It could be that all of

124
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,700
them are identified. But it could be that some female tertia are actually female angelata in the

125
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
way that I'm using it, and vice versa.

126
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,900
Pyromycin.

127
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,260
I mentioned this before. Wagner thinks that the western species are all occidentalists,

128
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:13,580
and the late flying ones are a bit smaller and darker than the early flying ones. So there's a gen,

129
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,380
there are generations, and they're slightly different in coloration. And I think this variability

130
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,420
is why there's too many names. But the, there was a monograph on Pyro, and they couldn't

131
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,380
differentiate the western species on the basis of genitalia. And it may be because they're just one

132
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,340
variable species.

133
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,980
Petrophila halus callus, or Confus salus. These are the ones that I could, before I knew how to separate

134
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:54,140
the two species, this is where I put the ones that I didn't retain, that I didn't identify.

135
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,780
And there seems to be about equally abundant.

136
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,860
And I talked about those previously.

137
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,340
Although it looks like Confus salus.

138
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,740
Didn't make the list.

139
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,300
Didn't make the list. So I guess Halley's callus is more

140
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,700
common that, or maybe they both didn't make, oh here it is.

141
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,900
It's more common there.

142
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:36,780
Farinay sub-punctata. Farinay is a fairly large genus. And over the years, I was given several

143
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:44,140
different names for them, all of which are plausible. They're difficult to identify. And I haven't bothered

144
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:51,020
to dissect them because I have no illustrations to separate them. But I've saved quite a few of them. But

145
00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:03,100
I suspect there's at least two species and possibly more. And many are reported from this area.

146
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:16,460
Phygalia plumogeraria feeds on adenostoma. The female is flightless. It's just a big,

147
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:28,140
big blob. And the males have extremely plumocentani, very feathery looking. And they fly early in the year.

148
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,420
And the females, of course, don't fly at all.

149
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:44,460
Phobolosia amphracta is a kind of attractive looking noctuaid, or a rivet, I guess. And

150
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:52,860
so all of them would have been recorded. And because it's kind of a spiffy looking species,

151
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,580
I have a tendency to collect most of the ones that come to the sheep.

152
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:10,140
Okay, this one here should read Phobos or Telethusia. The caption is partly obscured on the printout.

153
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:20,380
Yeah. And as you saw in that, I started to identify some of the unidentified specimens that I retained.

154
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:31,180
And the ones that I didn't identify, I think, are a mixture of Phobos and Sertus and maybe a few Telethusia.

155
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,740
But I think Telethusia is fairly uncommon at the Culp Canyon.

156
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,100
But I think this was mostly early specimens that I didn't identify.

157
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,980
Once I dissected enough of them, I could see subtle differences between the species.

158
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,860
And one or two of them are easy to identify. The other one's not so easy.

159
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,620
But we seem to have all the Phobos species there are known at Culp Canyon.

160
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:15,340
The Physetodes musidela we discussed. But I think that I have included in here some specimens of Baphyla aramiata.

161
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,700
Because there's more variability in the specimens I retained than there should be.

162
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,820
And I mentioned that before, that Baphyla is similar.

163
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:38,220
And Baphyla is the one that feeds on scales. And Physetodes feeds on, it's known to feed on

164
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,420
seeds of composites, flower heads of composites. Probably feeds on other things as well.

165
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:54,060
Philodesma americana is a Lyman triad.

166
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:04,860
And there was some confusion about the names, but in the checklist, the ones that it was confused with is now synonymized.

167
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,860
That's good.

168
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,380
That solved that problem.

169
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,180
Frutella xylastella is diamondback moth, and you know, that's everywhere.

170
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,980
But there are similar looking species that could be confused with it.

171
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:28,460
I don't believe that I've confused it with it, but there's always a possibility

172
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,740
to tell it.

173
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:41,020
Frutella xylastella is a geometrid in Davis as well, feeds on coyote bush.

174
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,500
And there was an Australian here who was investigating it as a candidate for biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia.

175
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Frutella xylastella is common, easily identified, but does look a little bit like suffusive.

176
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:17,020
But if you see them side by side, you know they're different species.

177
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,700
Frutella xylastella is different.

178
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,060
This is a gray species.

179
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,180
The other two are brown.

180
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,540
These are all Nocturids.

181
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:41,100
Procerpinus lucidus is a sphinged, flies in the winter,

182
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:50,140
has very green to greenish forewings and orange hindwing, very distinctive moth.

183
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:57,820
It was, for years, a collector's prize because people didn't know that it flew in the winter.

184
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,020
But once they figured out that it flew in the winter, they collected a lot of them.

185
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,220
Females seldom come to light, so almost all the specimens in collections are males.

186
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,700
But as it happened, the first one I ever got was a female.

187
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,740
And there's protangery.

188
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,580
The males fly earlier than the females.

189
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,780
And they disappeared for a long time.

190
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,300
And then the last year that I was there, I got two specimens.

191
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,380
So they're not gone.

192
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,500
I just, I think they have population cycles.

193
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,060
And they feed on...

194
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh, what's the family?

195
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,980
Oh, you can look it up.

196
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,220
Proxenus mendara, we talked about before.

197
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,660
There could be two species.

198
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
I don't, I don't know.

199
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,180
The males are supposed, of these two species, mendara and miranda.

200
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:10,300
And as you'll notice, those are anagrams of one another, which they sometimes do when you have similar species.

201
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:19,260
The males have different antennae, but I don't know what they're supposed to look like.

202
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:28,140
So I've called them, um, mendara because that was the name that Ron Robertson gave me.

203
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:36,060
But he kind of shrugged and said, mendara, I guess, but it flies over a long period of time and

204
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,060
seems to have big fluctuations in abundance.

205
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,460
I'm going to pause the recording.

206
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,700
Okay.
