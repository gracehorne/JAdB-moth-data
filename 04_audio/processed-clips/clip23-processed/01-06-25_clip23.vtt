WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Hygiumina. There's two species here. These are geometrids, common name high flyer moths,

00:12.720 --> 00:25.720
and these two species, albifaciata and nubifaciata, both feed on oaks, and they can show up in outbreak

00:25.720 --> 00:32.680
numbers any particular year. So with all the oaks having been burned at Cold Canyon, it'll be

00:32.680 --> 00:39.520
interesting to see what's happened to the population if somebody goes back there in the

00:39.520 --> 00:47.800
future and looks for albifaciata. They're both quite variable in phenotypes and forming patterns,

00:47.800 --> 00:57.480
and albifaciata always has a white spot that you can see, and it flies a little bit later

00:57.480 --> 01:03.720
than nubile fasciata. Nubile fasciata is a common species in Davis, and I've only got albifaciata

01:03.720 --> 01:12.920
once in my yard, and it quite possibly was a hitchhiker from a visit to Cold Canyon, and

01:12.920 --> 01:27.160
that's always a possibility. Hystricophora leonana is a Olethrutine tortricid, and I think its

01:27.160 --> 01:39.160
life history is unknown, but Powell speculated that it bores into roots of chaparral pea, which

01:39.160 --> 01:46.040
used to be called soraliella, P-S-O-R, and now it's in a different genus. Rupertia, I think,

01:46.040 --> 01:53.160
is the new genus. How do I remember things like that? I don't know. I don't know. I could never.

01:53.720 --> 02:01.240
Just when, you know, when you remember things certain ways, they don't go away, but other things

02:01.240 --> 02:08.920
are just ephemeral. Yeah, well, this is your talent. They go away like, you know, a whiff of smoke.

02:08.920 --> 02:16.120
Yeah. Idea bona fata. The ones that, this is a tiny

02:18.360 --> 02:27.720
geometric, as small as many micros, and smaller than, I'd say, half the so-called micro moths,

02:28.360 --> 02:35.640
and the ones in my backyard in Davis are smaller than the ones at Cold Canyon and paler than the

02:35.640 --> 02:42.920
ones at Cold Canyon, and I gave a specimen to Wagner who said he would do DNA on it, but he never did, or

02:45.160 --> 02:53.160
if he did, he didn't give me the results, and this has a long flight period, and I don't know

02:53.160 --> 02:59.480
if anything's known about the hosts, but I think this group of geometras

03:02.200 --> 03:06.200
is alleged to feed on annuals, and

03:06.200 --> 03:10.840
I can't say that that's true of this one.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.760
Idea demyceria. This is possibly more than one species that I'm using here.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.520
Originally, I was given a different name for this from

03:24.280 --> 03:28.360
Ron Leuchner, who was kind of notorious for erroneous

03:28.360 --> 03:36.440
identifications, but he had the genus right anyway, and it wasn't until I saw pictures of the two species

03:36.440 --> 03:42.440
on the moth photographer's group that I decided that this was a better name for it,

03:43.080 --> 03:52.680
but the other species name was Eremiata, E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A, and it could be that we have both species,

03:52.680 --> 03:56.360
and if so, they're all recorded as demyceria now.

03:58.120 --> 04:06.680
This is a subfamily of geometrids that was being studied by somebody who's now in Florida,

04:07.480 --> 04:12.120
and he corralled all the specimens and held on them for years and years and years,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.080
and never got anywhere worth of work, and finally,

04:16.120 --> 04:20.520
you know, repatriated, and by that time he was no longer working on the group, so

04:22.120 --> 04:25.960
many of the specimens, when they were returned, were in poor condition, and

04:28.200 --> 04:35.160
so it remains a group that needs to be looked at.

04:36.680 --> 04:41.400
So, idea americalis.

04:45.240 --> 04:49.480
This is right at the beginning of the checklist on geometrics,

04:49.480 --> 04:58.040
and it's reasonably easy to look like, to identify.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.680
It looks a little like a geometric though, and I don't know anything about the host flint.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.280
And again, as I said before, if I know that something is a non-native species,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.240
I'll bring it up, but most of the time I know nothing.

05:11.240 --> 05:11.800
Okay.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.720
Idea lubricalis.

05:16.600 --> 05:25.320
I was using the name lubricalis until this species called occidentalis was removed from synonymy.

05:25.320 --> 05:31.960
And then, for a while, moth photographers group showed that all of the specimens from

05:32.440 --> 05:36.440
California were, in the West, were occidentalis.

05:36.840 --> 05:42.760
But when you look at the pictures, the ones that we get here look more like lubricalis than occidentalis.

05:42.760 --> 05:49.480
So, I'm not sure which is the correct name.

05:49.480 --> 05:56.280
I haven't dissected them, but I think they're all, they're only one species out here.

05:56.280 --> 06:09.560
And if the wing pattern is diagnostic, they're probably locally lubricalis and not occidentalis, but

06:13.400 --> 06:18.920
I think you can analyze them as a single species and feel confident they are.

06:18.920 --> 06:36.760
So, Iridopsis clivenaria, this one can be confused with the species Pachydaria, which is

06:37.400 --> 06:43.960
Ethaloida, A-E-T-H-L-O-I-D-I-A.

06:43.960 --> 06:53.800
This entire group of geometrids are confusingly similar to one another.

06:55.560 --> 07:00.280
But this one is somewhat distinct. There are other species in the genus,

07:01.080 --> 07:06.280
but every specimen that I've caught matches up pretty well with clivenaria.

07:06.280 --> 07:18.280
Pachydaria, the similar species, is smaller, but Mariah, when she reared some,

07:21.320 --> 07:28.120
they were starved slightly, and so she reared some runts, and the runts were very easily confused

07:28.120 --> 07:33.240
with Pachydaria. And I believe it fed on Adenostoma.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.400
Keferia Elmori is the native,

07:43.880 --> 07:54.680
this is a Gelicheid, and it is almost identical to Keferia Lycopersicella, which is a pest of cotton.

07:54.680 --> 08:04.200
And whether or not their two species are not as

08:06.920 --> 08:17.400
disputed. What may be happening is Lycopersicella was introduced with cotton, and that

08:17.400 --> 08:27.160
they are hybridizing now, so we have hybrid populations. But in general, it's not that

08:28.200 --> 08:29.720
populations on

08:32.360 --> 08:37.640
and away from cotton fields are probably, in California, Elmori.

08:37.640 --> 08:50.920
But it's a Noramashamine, Gelicheid, and all the Noramashamines are very difficult to tell apart

08:50.920 --> 09:00.440
from one another just by looking at them. So it's almost a certainty that I have not recorded every

09:00.440 --> 09:07.240
specimen of Keferia, no matter what. And then all the Noramashamines were borrowed by

09:09.160 --> 09:16.680
Varick, and are sitting now in Canada. And Varick got fired, so we'll never work on it,

09:16.680 --> 09:22.520
for possession of child pornography, among all things.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.200
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

09:25.480 --> 09:32.520
He went to the slammer for a while, and he's out, but he's no longer employed.

09:32.520 --> 09:45.000
Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark species. There's a number of species of Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark

09:45.000 --> 09:53.640
species, and I use kind of that dark general appearance to identify them. Flies early in the

09:53.640 --> 10:00.680
year, and I think they're all identified and all recorded, but dark individuals are some similar

10:00.680 --> 10:10.520
looking species, could be under this name erroneously. So, Lysinopolia is a difficult genus.

10:11.560 --> 10:18.200
Part of it was revised recently, and I found that one species turned out to be two,

10:18.200 --> 10:21.320
neither of which was the name I was formerly using. So,

10:21.320 --> 10:31.880
things happen to change concepts. Lysinopolia quadrilineata has a characteristic

10:31.880 --> 10:39.400
dash on the hind wing, or on the forewing, and the hind wing is white. So, this one is fairly

10:39.400 --> 10:47.400
easy to identify, but some specimens look like the next one, Strigicollis. And quadrilineata is the

10:47.400 --> 10:55.160
common species in Davis. Strigicollis is second to that. And then it looks like none of the others

10:55.160 --> 11:07.080
qualified to make your analysis. Lucania, Oaxacana. Lucania and a couple of other genera are very

11:07.080 --> 11:11.960
similar to one another. Alicia is one of the other ones. And Mithymna used to be called

11:11.960 --> 11:21.960
Sudalicia. These are all kind of pale tan with streaks and various amounts. Very difficult to

11:21.960 --> 11:29.400
identify on the basis of wing pattern alone. And this is the name that I've been using,

11:29.400 --> 11:37.720
but Fulker Heinrich has been calling them Occidentalis, I think, rather than Oaxacanis.

11:37.720 --> 11:46.440
I think there's only one species. Some of them could be misidentified, Mithymna unupuncta, but

11:47.240 --> 11:53.640
I think what I've called Lucania are all Lucania. And I think they're only one species, but

11:55.640 --> 12:04.760
Bill Patterson recorded one other species from Quail Ridge. So, if he was correct, there could be other

12:04.760 --> 12:16.680
species in the area. There was a web page on this genus that was recently removed, but it only covered

12:16.680 --> 12:26.040
specimen species that were in the possession of the Smithsonian. So, some of the western species

12:26.040 --> 12:39.160
weren't there. So, it was only okay. But what he tried to do is give characters for identifying them

12:39.160 --> 12:47.160
without having to rely on genitalia, which was a noble effort. But when you don't have all the species,

12:47.160 --> 12:58.680
that it was only so-so. Luca Guniella and Distincta, I have, these can, to me, they can only be

12:58.680 --> 13:07.800
tailed apart by doing dissections. And I have dissected a few and found two different genitalia

13:07.800 --> 13:13.320
species among one of the sexes, I think. And I have illustrations of both. And I could

13:14.760 --> 13:24.760
positively match them up with the illustrations that I have. So, I think we have both. And

13:25.640 --> 13:32.440
most of them I've just recorded as a combination of the two. And there's a third species, which I think

13:32.440 --> 13:41.800
is just even more distinctive, despite the name Distincta. And it's not in our area as far as I know.

13:41.800 --> 13:49.000
But there are other species and other genera of Galechaeids, which also look like these. So,

13:51.160 --> 13:58.520
it's hard. Galechaeids are hard. And there's only one person working on them at present, I think. And,

13:58.520 --> 14:01.000
you know, she can only do so much.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.880
Mm-hmm.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.840
Leniote's Integra is a

14:09.800 --> 14:14.600
crambine pyroloid that looks like a

14:15.640 --> 14:22.600
pterophora that doesn't have the wings deeply cleft. And I reared it from

14:22.600 --> 14:33.240
native solanum at Cold Cannon. And I think I've got it in my yard a few times.

14:34.360 --> 14:41.320
There is an introduced species that feeds on honeysuckle that turned up in the Bay Area,

14:41.320 --> 14:48.840
but I haven't seen it around here yet. So, you know, long legs, narrow wings like a pterophora.

14:48.840 --> 14:53.800
But unlike pterophoras, the legs don't fall off easily.

14:57.800 --> 15:04.280
Palos suspected that's convergent evolution with crane flies, because crane flies, the legs fall off

15:04.280 --> 15:10.840
really easily too. But whether there's any advantage to that, I guess, is debatable.

15:10.840 --> 15:18.760
Macaria Adonis, I don't know too much about it, but this was in a recent monograph

15:23.320 --> 15:28.520
that included its authors Wagner. And the monograph

15:28.520 --> 15:37.800
is good as far as it went, but there's certain groups. But this is a fairly distinctive one,

15:37.800 --> 15:42.840
and I think all of them have been recorded. But there is a similar looking species that

15:44.200 --> 15:48.760
known from California, but I don't think we have it here. I got this once in Davis.

15:48.760 --> 16:02.520
Macaria Extemporada is, again, food plants might be listed in that monograph for all of these,

16:02.520 --> 16:09.720
Macaria and Digramia. And these used to be in Semiotiza and other genera, but

16:09.720 --> 16:22.520
Guennaia area, fairly common, different than the other ones around here, but similar to species

16:22.520 --> 16:29.480
that are not from around here. So I think they're all identified correctly. Time for water.

16:29.480 --> 16:34.680
I got one in my yard this year for the first time.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.520
Messina Mustelinalis, um, a crambined,

16:48.520 --> 16:54.280
crambid, it's no longer a subfamily. It's a crambid, uh, pyraloid.

16:54.280 --> 17:03.240
Feeds on grasses, almost certainly. And, um, fairly widespread, fairly common,

17:03.240 --> 17:18.280
but I don't believe I've ever got it in Davis. But there's no reason why it shouldn't be here.
