0	12720	Hygiumina. There's two species here. These are geometrids, common name high flyer moths,
12720	25720	and these two species, albifaciata and nubifaciata, both feed on oaks, and they can show up in outbreak
25720	32680	numbers any particular year. So with all the oaks having been burned at Cold Canyon, it'll be
32680	39520	interesting to see what's happened to the population if somebody goes back there in the
39520	47800	future and looks for albifaciata. They're both quite variable in phenotypes and forming patterns,
47800	57480	and albifaciata always has a white spot that you can see, and it flies a little bit later
57480	63720	than nubile fasciata. Nubile fasciata is a common species in Davis, and I've only got albifaciata
63720	72920	once in my yard, and it quite possibly was a hitchhiker from a visit to Cold Canyon, and
72920	87160	that's always a possibility. Hystricophora leonana is a Olethrutine tortricid, and I think its
87160	99160	life history is unknown, but Powell speculated that it bores into roots of chaparral pea, which
99160	106040	used to be called soraliella, P-S-O-R, and now it's in a different genus. Rupertia, I think,
106040	113160	is the new genus. How do I remember things like that? I don't know. I don't know. I could never.
113720	121240	Just when, you know, when you remember things certain ways, they don't go away, but other things
121240	128920	are just ephemeral. Yeah, well, this is your talent. They go away like, you know, a whiff of smoke.
128920	136120	Yeah. Idea bona fata. The ones that, this is a tiny
138360	147720	geometric, as small as many micros, and smaller than, I'd say, half the so-called micro moths,
148360	155640	and the ones in my backyard in Davis are smaller than the ones at Cold Canyon and paler than the
155640	162920	ones at Cold Canyon, and I gave a specimen to Wagner who said he would do DNA on it, but he never did, or
165160	173160	if he did, he didn't give me the results, and this has a long flight period, and I don't know
173160	179480	if anything's known about the hosts, but I think this group of geometras
182200	186200	is alleged to feed on annuals, and
186200	190840	I can't say that that's true of this one.
194280	198760	Idea demyceria. This is possibly more than one species that I'm using here.
199480	202520	Originally, I was given a different name for this from
204280	208360	Ron Leuchner, who was kind of notorious for erroneous
208360	216440	identifications, but he had the genus right anyway, and it wasn't until I saw pictures of the two species
216440	222440	on the moth photographer's group that I decided that this was a better name for it,
223080	232680	but the other species name was Eremiata, E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A, and it could be that we have both species,
232680	236360	and if so, they're all recorded as demyceria now.
238120	246680	This is a subfamily of geometrids that was being studied by somebody who's now in Florida,
247480	252120	and he corralled all the specimens and held on them for years and years and years,
252680	255080	and never got anywhere worth of work, and finally,
256120	260520	you know, repatriated, and by that time he was no longer working on the group, so
262120	265960	many of the specimens, when they were returned, were in poor condition, and
268200	275160	so it remains a group that needs to be looked at.
276680	281400	So, idea americalis.
285240	289480	This is right at the beginning of the checklist on geometrics,
289480	298040	and it's reasonably easy to look like, to identify.
298040	302680	It looks a little like a geometric though, and I don't know anything about the host flint.
304040	308280	And again, as I said before, if I know that something is a non-native species,
308280	311240	I'll bring it up, but most of the time I know nothing.
311240	311800	Okay.
314120	315720	Idea lubricalis.
316600	325320	I was using the name lubricalis until this species called occidentalis was removed from synonymy.
325320	331960	And then, for a while, moth photographers group showed that all of the specimens from
332440	336440	California were, in the West, were occidentalis.
336840	342760	But when you look at the pictures, the ones that we get here look more like lubricalis than occidentalis.
342760	349480	So, I'm not sure which is the correct name.
349480	356280	I haven't dissected them, but I think they're all, they're only one species out here.
356280	369560	And if the wing pattern is diagnostic, they're probably locally lubricalis and not occidentalis, but
373400	378920	I think you can analyze them as a single species and feel confident they are.
378920	396760	So, Iridopsis clivenaria, this one can be confused with the species Pachydaria, which is
397400	403960	Ethaloida, A-E-T-H-L-O-I-D-I-A.
403960	413800	This entire group of geometrids are confusingly similar to one another.
415560	420280	But this one is somewhat distinct. There are other species in the genus,
421080	426280	but every specimen that I've caught matches up pretty well with clivenaria.
426280	438280	Pachydaria, the similar species, is smaller, but Mariah, when she reared some,
441320	448120	they were starved slightly, and so she reared some runts, and the runts were very easily confused
448120	453240	with Pachydaria. And I believe it fed on Adenostoma.
457960	461400	Keferia Elmori is the native,
463880	474680	this is a Gelicheid, and it is almost identical to Keferia Lycopersicella, which is a pest of cotton.
474680	484200	And whether or not their two species are not as
486920	497400	disputed. What may be happening is Lycopersicella was introduced with cotton, and that
497400	507160	they are hybridizing now, so we have hybrid populations. But in general, it's not that
508200	509720	populations on
512360	517640	and away from cotton fields are probably, in California, Elmori.
517640	530920	But it's a Noramashamine, Gelicheid, and all the Noramashamines are very difficult to tell apart
530920	540440	from one another just by looking at them. So it's almost a certainty that I have not recorded every
540440	547240	specimen of Keferia, no matter what. And then all the Noramashamines were borrowed by
549160	556680	Varick, and are sitting now in Canada. And Varick got fired, so we'll never work on it,
556680	562520	for possession of child pornography, among all things.
562520	564200	Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
565480	572520	He went to the slammer for a while, and he's out, but he's no longer employed.
572520	585000	Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark species. There's a number of species of Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark
585000	593640	species, and I use kind of that dark general appearance to identify them. Flies early in the
593640	600680	year, and I think they're all identified and all recorded, but dark individuals are some similar
600680	610520	looking species, could be under this name erroneously. So, Lysinopolia is a difficult genus.
611560	618200	Part of it was revised recently, and I found that one species turned out to be two,
618200	621320	neither of which was the name I was formerly using. So,
621320	631880	things happen to change concepts. Lysinopolia quadrilineata has a characteristic
631880	639400	dash on the hind wing, or on the forewing, and the hind wing is white. So, this one is fairly
639400	647400	easy to identify, but some specimens look like the next one, Strigicollis. And quadrilineata is the
647400	655160	common species in Davis. Strigicollis is second to that. And then it looks like none of the others
655160	667080	qualified to make your analysis. Lucania, Oaxacana. Lucania and a couple of other genera are very
667080	671960	similar to one another. Alicia is one of the other ones. And Mithymna used to be called
671960	681960	Sudalicia. These are all kind of pale tan with streaks and various amounts. Very difficult to
681960	689400	identify on the basis of wing pattern alone. And this is the name that I've been using,
689400	697720	but Fulker Heinrich has been calling them Occidentalis, I think, rather than Oaxacanis.
697720	706440	I think there's only one species. Some of them could be misidentified, Mithymna unupuncta, but
707240	713640	I think what I've called Lucania are all Lucania. And I think they're only one species, but
715640	724760	Bill Patterson recorded one other species from Quail Ridge. So, if he was correct, there could be other
724760	736680	species in the area. There was a web page on this genus that was recently removed, but it only covered
736680	746040	specimen species that were in the possession of the Smithsonian. So, some of the western species
746040	759160	weren't there. So, it was only okay. But what he tried to do is give characters for identifying them
759160	767160	without having to rely on genitalia, which was a noble effort. But when you don't have all the species,
767160	778680	that it was only so-so. Luca Guniella and Distincta, I have, these can, to me, they can only be
778680	787800	tailed apart by doing dissections. And I have dissected a few and found two different genitalia
787800	793320	species among one of the sexes, I think. And I have illustrations of both. And I could
794760	804760	positively match them up with the illustrations that I have. So, I think we have both. And
805640	812440	most of them I've just recorded as a combination of the two. And there's a third species, which I think
812440	821800	is just even more distinctive, despite the name Distincta. And it's not in our area as far as I know.
821800	829000	But there are other species and other genera of Galechaeids, which also look like these. So,
831160	838520	it's hard. Galechaeids are hard. And there's only one person working on them at present, I think. And,
838520	841000	you know, she can only do so much.
841000	841880	Mm-hmm.
844360	846840	Leniote's Integra is a
849800	854600	crambine pyroloid that looks like a
855640	862600	pterophora that doesn't have the wings deeply cleft. And I reared it from
862600	873240	native solanum at Cold Cannon. And I think I've got it in my yard a few times.
874360	881320	There is an introduced species that feeds on honeysuckle that turned up in the Bay Area,
881320	888840	but I haven't seen it around here yet. So, you know, long legs, narrow wings like a pterophora.
888840	893800	But unlike pterophoras, the legs don't fall off easily.
897800	904280	Palos suspected that's convergent evolution with crane flies, because crane flies, the legs fall off
904280	910840	really easily too. But whether there's any advantage to that, I guess, is debatable.
910840	918760	Macaria Adonis, I don't know too much about it, but this was in a recent monograph
923320	928520	that included its authors Wagner. And the monograph
928520	937800	is good as far as it went, but there's certain groups. But this is a fairly distinctive one,
937800	942840	and I think all of them have been recorded. But there is a similar looking species that
944200	948760	known from California, but I don't think we have it here. I got this once in Davis.
948760	962520	Macaria Extemporada is, again, food plants might be listed in that monograph for all of these,
962520	969720	Macaria and Digramia. And these used to be in Semiotiza and other genera, but
969720	982520	Guennaia area, fairly common, different than the other ones around here, but similar to species
982520	989480	that are not from around here. So I think they're all identified correctly. Time for water.
989480	994680	I got one in my yard this year for the first time.
1001480	1006520	Messina Mustelinalis, um, a crambined,
1008520	1014280	crambid, it's no longer a subfamily. It's a crambid, uh, pyraloid.
1014280	1023240	Feeds on grasses, almost certainly. And, um, fairly widespread, fairly common,
1023240	1038280	but I don't believe I've ever got it in Davis. But there's no reason why it shouldn't be here.
