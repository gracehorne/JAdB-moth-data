1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Hygiumina. There's two species here. These are geometrids, common name high flyer moths,

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:25,720
and these two species, albifaciata and nubifaciata, both feed on oaks, and they can show up in outbreak

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,680
numbers any particular year. So with all the oaks having been burned at Cold Canyon, it'll be

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,520
interesting to see what's happened to the population if somebody goes back there in the

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,800
future and looks for albifaciata. They're both quite variable in phenotypes and forming patterns,

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:57,480
and albifaciata always has a white spot that you can see, and it flies a little bit later

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,720
than nubile fasciata. Nubile fasciata is a common species in Davis, and I've only got albifaciata

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:12,920
once in my yard, and it quite possibly was a hitchhiker from a visit to Cold Canyon, and

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:27,160
that's always a possibility. Hystricophora leonana is a Olethrutine tortricid, and I think its

10
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:39,160
life history is unknown, but Powell speculated that it bores into roots of chaparral pea, which

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:46,040
used to be called soraliella, P-S-O-R, and now it's in a different genus. Rupertia, I think,

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,160
is the new genus. How do I remember things like that? I don't know. I don't know. I could never.

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,240
Just when, you know, when you remember things certain ways, they don't go away, but other things

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,920
are just ephemeral. Yeah, well, this is your talent. They go away like, you know, a whiff of smoke.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,120
Yeah. Idea bona fata. The ones that, this is a tiny

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,720
geometric, as small as many micros, and smaller than, I'd say, half the so-called micro moths,

17
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,640
and the ones in my backyard in Davis are smaller than the ones at Cold Canyon and paler than the

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,920
ones at Cold Canyon, and I gave a specimen to Wagner who said he would do DNA on it, but he never did, or

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:53,160
if he did, he didn't give me the results, and this has a long flight period, and I don't know

20
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,480
if anything's known about the hosts, but I think this group of geometras

21
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
is alleged to feed on annuals, and

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,840
I can't say that that's true of this one.

23
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Idea demyceria. This is possibly more than one species that I'm using here.

24
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,520
Originally, I was given a different name for this from

25
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Ron Leuchner, who was kind of notorious for erroneous

26
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:36,440
identifications, but he had the genus right anyway, and it wasn't until I saw pictures of the two species

27
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,440
on the moth photographer's group that I decided that this was a better name for it,

28
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:52,680
but the other species name was Eremiata, E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A, and it could be that we have both species,

29
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,360
and if so, they're all recorded as demyceria now.

30
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:06,680
This is a subfamily of geometrids that was being studied by somebody who's now in Florida,

31
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,120
and he corralled all the specimens and held on them for years and years and years,

32
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,080
and never got anywhere worth of work, and finally,

33
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,520
you know, repatriated, and by that time he was no longer working on the group, so

34
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,960
many of the specimens, when they were returned, were in poor condition, and

35
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,160
so it remains a group that needs to be looked at.

36
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,400
So, idea americalis.

37
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,480
This is right at the beginning of the checklist on geometrics,

38
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:58,040
and it's reasonably easy to look like, to identify.

39
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,680
It looks a little like a geometric though, and I don't know anything about the host flint.

40
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,280
And again, as I said before, if I know that something is a non-native species,

41
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll bring it up, but most of the time I know nothing.

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,800
Okay.

43
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
Idea lubricalis.

44
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:25,320
I was using the name lubricalis until this species called occidentalis was removed from synonymy.

45
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,960
And then, for a while, moth photographers group showed that all of the specimens from

46
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,440
California were, in the West, were occidentalis.

47
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,760
But when you look at the pictures, the ones that we get here look more like lubricalis than occidentalis.

48
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,480
So, I'm not sure which is the correct name.

49
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,280
I haven't dissected them, but I think they're all, they're only one species out here.

50
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:09,560
And if the wing pattern is diagnostic, they're probably locally lubricalis and not occidentalis, but

51
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,920
I think you can analyze them as a single species and feel confident they are.

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:36,760
So, Iridopsis clivenaria, this one can be confused with the species Pachydaria, which is

53
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,960
Ethaloida, A-E-T-H-L-O-I-D-I-A.

54
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:53,800
This entire group of geometrids are confusingly similar to one another.

55
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,280
But this one is somewhat distinct. There are other species in the genus,

56
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,280
but every specimen that I've caught matches up pretty well with clivenaria.

57
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Pachydaria, the similar species, is smaller, but Mariah, when she reared some,

58
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,120
they were starved slightly, and so she reared some runts, and the runts were very easily confused

59
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,240
with Pachydaria. And I believe it fed on Adenostoma.

60
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,400
Keferia Elmori is the native,

61
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:54,680
this is a Gelicheid, and it is almost identical to Keferia Lycopersicella, which is a pest of cotton.

62
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:04,200
And whether or not their two species are not as

63
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:17,400
disputed. What may be happening is Lycopersicella was introduced with cotton, and that

64
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:27,160
they are hybridizing now, so we have hybrid populations. But in general, it's not that

65
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
populations on

66
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,640
and away from cotton fields are probably, in California, Elmori.

67
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:50,920
But it's a Noramashamine, Gelicheid, and all the Noramashamines are very difficult to tell apart

68
00:08:50,920 --> 00:09:00,440
from one another just by looking at them. So it's almost a certainty that I have not recorded every

69
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:07,240
specimen of Keferia, no matter what. And then all the Noramashamines were borrowed by

70
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,680
Varick, and are sitting now in Canada. And Varick got fired, so we'll never work on it,

71
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,520
for possession of child pornography, among all things.

72
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

73
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,520
He went to the slammer for a while, and he's out, but he's no longer employed.

74
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:45,000
Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark species. There's a number of species of Lysinopolia cuneata is a dark

75
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,640
species, and I use kind of that dark general appearance to identify them. Flies early in the

76
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,680
year, and I think they're all identified and all recorded, but dark individuals are some similar

77
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:10,520
looking species, could be under this name erroneously. So, Lysinopolia is a difficult genus.

78
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,200
Part of it was revised recently, and I found that one species turned out to be two,

79
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,320
neither of which was the name I was formerly using. So,

80
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:31,880
things happen to change concepts. Lysinopolia quadrilineata has a characteristic

81
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,400
dash on the hind wing, or on the forewing, and the hind wing is white. So, this one is fairly

82
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:47,400
easy to identify, but some specimens look like the next one, Strigicollis. And quadrilineata is the

83
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:55,160
common species in Davis. Strigicollis is second to that. And then it looks like none of the others

84
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:07,080
qualified to make your analysis. Lucania, Oaxacana. Lucania and a couple of other genera are very

85
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,960
similar to one another. Alicia is one of the other ones. And Mithymna used to be called

86
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Sudalicia. These are all kind of pale tan with streaks and various amounts. Very difficult to

87
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,400
identify on the basis of wing pattern alone. And this is the name that I've been using,

88
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,720
but Fulker Heinrich has been calling them Occidentalis, I think, rather than Oaxacanis.

89
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:46,440
I think there's only one species. Some of them could be misidentified, Mithymna unupuncta, but

90
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,640
I think what I've called Lucania are all Lucania. And I think they're only one species, but

91
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:04,760
Bill Patterson recorded one other species from Quail Ridge. So, if he was correct, there could be other

92
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:16,680
species in the area. There was a web page on this genus that was recently removed, but it only covered

93
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:26,040
specimen species that were in the possession of the Smithsonian. So, some of the western species

94
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:39,160
weren't there. So, it was only okay. But what he tried to do is give characters for identifying them

95
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:47,160
without having to rely on genitalia, which was a noble effort. But when you don't have all the species,

96
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:58,680
that it was only so-so. Luca Guniella and Distincta, I have, these can, to me, they can only be

97
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:07,800
tailed apart by doing dissections. And I have dissected a few and found two different genitalia

98
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,320
species among one of the sexes, I think. And I have illustrations of both. And I could

99
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:24,760
positively match them up with the illustrations that I have. So, I think we have both. And

100
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,440
most of them I've just recorded as a combination of the two. And there's a third species, which I think

101
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:41,800
is just even more distinctive, despite the name Distincta. And it's not in our area as far as I know.

102
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:49,000
But there are other species and other genera of Galechaeids, which also look like these. So,

103
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,520
it's hard. Galechaeids are hard. And there's only one person working on them at present, I think. And,

104
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,000
you know, she can only do so much.

105
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
Mm-hmm.

106
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Leniote's Integra is a

107
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,600
crambine pyroloid that looks like a

108
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:22,600
pterophora that doesn't have the wings deeply cleft. And I reared it from

109
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:33,240
native solanum at Cold Cannon. And I think I've got it in my yard a few times.

110
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,320
There is an introduced species that feeds on honeysuckle that turned up in the Bay Area,

111
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,840
but I haven't seen it around here yet. So, you know, long legs, narrow wings like a pterophora.

112
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,800
But unlike pterophoras, the legs don't fall off easily.

113
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,280
Palos suspected that's convergent evolution with crane flies, because crane flies, the legs fall off

114
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,840
really easily too. But whether there's any advantage to that, I guess, is debatable.

115
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Macaria Adonis, I don't know too much about it, but this was in a recent monograph

116
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,520
that included its authors Wagner. And the monograph

117
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:37,800
is good as far as it went, but there's certain groups. But this is a fairly distinctive one,

118
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,840
and I think all of them have been recorded. But there is a similar looking species that

119
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,760
known from California, but I don't think we have it here. I got this once in Davis.

120
00:15:48,760 --> 00:16:02,520
Macaria Extemporada is, again, food plants might be listed in that monograph for all of these,

121
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,720
Macaria and Digramia. And these used to be in Semiotiza and other genera, but

122
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Guennaia area, fairly common, different than the other ones around here, but similar to species

123
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,480
that are not from around here. So I think they're all identified correctly. Time for water.

124
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,680
I got one in my yard this year for the first time.

125
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,520
Messina Mustelinalis, um, a crambined,

126
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,280
crambid, it's no longer a subfamily. It's a crambid, uh, pyraloid.

127
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:03,240
Feeds on grasses, almost certainly. And, um, fairly widespread, fairly common,

128
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:18,280
but I don't believe I've ever got it in Davis. But there's no reason why it shouldn't be here.
