1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
All right, we are recording on December 18, 2024, so it might be good if we kept that information.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
And we're ready to go, we're talking about Stubbins.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,160
Ducantistanda is a true ecophore, and it's not one that was split off into depressarity.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:36,660
It's a kind of yellowish-tan moth with gold spots and bars, so it's easy to recognize, at least in a fresh specimen.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:54,100
And it was in a different genus, under a different name at one time, and it got split into a few species when they did the ecophore fascicle in the Mona series.

6
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:05,680
And this is the only species I found at Cold Canyon, and it turns up more frequently on the upper trail.

7
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,400
And that's the West Trail.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,340
And I may be erroneous about this.

9
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:27,960
It may feed in either rotting wood or old logs, but there, there was a pile of dead wood, and that may have been the source of it being more common.

10
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,220
But I'd have to look up and see what's known about the host plant.

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,740
I don't know whether it's been reared.

12
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,740
The next two species in Ducotis are tortricis on oaks.

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,300
And what's unusual is Basiplegona and Fragariana.

14
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,340
Usually you have one but not the other.

15
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
But here we have both of them at Cold Canyon.

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,020
And whether they feed on the same oaks or not, I couldn't tell you.

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,320
And they're somewhat similar.

18
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,380
Basiplegona has more orangish on it, where the other one has various tones of gray and black.

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,980
But I think that I have recorded most of them accurately.

20
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:30,900
And this is one, you know, with the oaks having been burned out of Cold Canyon, it may plummet in numbers unless the oaks recover.

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,420
That's Diagramma?

22
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,420
The two Ducotis species.

23
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,020
Oh, Ducotis, got it.

24
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,760
Dicorda illustraria is one of those green geometrids.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,460
And this is the largest species there, very distinct.

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,380
And it shows up in modest numbers over the years.

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,560
Looks like there's a gap here, but I never thought that it disappeared or anything.

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
Diagrammia californiaria.

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,240
All of the Diagrammia species that are somewhat similar to one another.

30
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,960
When the monofascical came out maybe four or five years ago, I did a lot of dissections.

31
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:39,620
And California area has various forms, but there's kind of a consistent character that enables you to identify it without doing dissections,

32
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,640
regardless of these different forms, regardless of these different forms.

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,620
And it makes some dark triangular marks along the leading edge of the forewings.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,780
Leading when the wings are outshed, of course.

35
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,620
Ararada is the one that resembles Neptaria.

36
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,320
And Muscariata went under a couple of names previously.

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,420
And this is the one that we're using.

38
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,320
Neptaria is the one like Ararada.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Those plants are listed in that monograph.

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,320
I think all the species are native species.

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,140
But Nepensis is on conifers.

42
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,300
And it's in Davis, where there's no native conifers.

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:45,880
So it seems to either be naturally exploiting exotic plantings or it's getting introduced with them.

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,520
It's a Plymelata.

45
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,480
He's on willow.

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,380
I know that one.

47
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,820
And it used to be confused with another species.

48
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:07,320
And so in the early annual spreadseats, it's listed as aerobescence.

49
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,560
And one of the paratypes is from Cold Canyon.

50
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
And so we know that's a good one.

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,100
Diaryctria 4-di is a Pyrrolid in the Fisotines.

52
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,100
And it feeds on Pinus sabiniana.

53
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:47,780
And it's a large Diaryctria and very distinct from Muricae tivorella and the ones that resemble Muricae tivorella.

54
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
And I'll discuss that one next.

55
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:59,380
Recently, there was a paper that described some new species of Diaryctria with very subtle differences in genitalia.

56
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,460
And I have not re-examined to see whether what we're calling Fordi is one of the new species.

57
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,860
But Fordi was described from Mount Diablo, I believe.

58
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,380
And Mount Diablo, Cold Canyon is in an extension of what they call the Diablo Range.

59
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,940
So I think this is probably the right, the correct name of the species there.

60
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,640
But in any event, they're all distinct from the other Diaryctria, which is not the case for Muricae tivorella.

61
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:47,140
Muricae tivorella has kind of, it's various tones of gray and white and black.

62
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,700
Like many Fisotine pyrella feeds on conifers.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,540
Muricae tivorella is Monterey pine.

64
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,580
But obviously there's no native Monterey pine in Cold Canyon.

65
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,240
Oh, goodness.

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,780
But it probably feeds on other pines as well.

67
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,720
And some of the ones that I called Muricae tivorella do have blurred patterns.

68
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,040
And I think that's a good name for them, where other ones don't.

69
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,680
And the key character that was given in the monograph that includes Diaryctria says raised scales on the forewings.

70
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:41,340
So with raised scales, they're AB, AB tivorella, Feeson, ABs.

71
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:56,820
And I think that raised scale character is not reliable, partially because they might get mashed flat or they get abraded.

72
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:08,500
So I'm not certain that everything that I've called Muricae tivorella or AB tivorella have been correctly identified.

73
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,520
So there's a problem there.

74
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,060
But AB tivorella seems to have a wide range of conifers as hosts.

75
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,020
Are they all listed under here, both the AB tivorella?

76
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,500
Well, the two that are similar, Muricae tivorella and AB tivorella,

77
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,940
I have, from time to time, combined them and then split them.

78
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:46,080
Okay, so AB tivorella might just be below the threshold of, like the number of sightings might be below the threshold of what we're seeing?

79
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:55,460
Or you used a version, which was before I decided to, before I tried to split them into two species.

80
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,560
The problem is, you know, I don't save every specimen that I collect.

81
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,880
But I think anything where there's a strong possibility of confusion,

82
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:17,800
if you analyze them as a single species, I think you need to annotate that there's a possibility that it includes more than one species.

83
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,160
Because the dynamics of those two species could be competitive.

84
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,220
Or it could be independent of one another.

85
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,500
So I don't know how specific Muricae tivorella is.

86
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,920
Obviously, it's not just a Monterey pine, because there's no Monterey pine out there.

87
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,200
And most of the pines here in Davis, which, where we get ones that mostly look like AB tivorella,

88
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,420
are, you know, like Italian stone pine and things like that.

89
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,520
So they're not even U.S. native species.

90
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,080
I just confirmed that they're not combined in the data set.

91
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,680
They're separate.

92
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,400
Okay.

93
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah, we'll deal with it.

94
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,620
There's another species there called Orantiaca.

95
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,460
And I would think that there was enough records of that, but it's not here.

96
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:25,840
And that one looks, it's rather than being, it's still a mottled moth, but it's kind of a rusty brown looking pattern.

97
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,720
It's rusty brown in coloration.

98
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,960
So it looks different than both these.

99
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,260
Fordi has brown on it, as well as blacks and grays.

100
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:33,620
Okay.

101
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,020
Plus, it's so much bigger than the other ones.

102
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,040
It's easy to identify.

103
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,740
So it's distinct, yeah, okay.

104
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,140
Got it.

105
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,180
Drasteria edler's eye is the most common of the several moths in that genus that I've collected at Gold Canyon.

106
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,960
And adults can be seen active during the day, as well as at night.

107
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:09,400
These are sometimes called false underwings because they're not Cotacola like the other, like true underwings.

108
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,200
But they do have colorful hindwings.

109
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:20,300
And they tend to be mostly smaller than all the Cotacola species.

110
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:30,180
And Edward's eye, Edward's Z eye, is the most common species by far.

111
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,140
And as I said, you see it active during the day.

112
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,060
It has a long flight season, so there might be multiple generations.

113
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,380
But it's hard to know.

114
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,540
Palisans is the second most common one.

115
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:55,060
And this one has a white underwing, whereas Edward's eye is kind of a deep yellow-orange hindwing.

116
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,700
Again, with those black markings similar to on a Cotacola true underwing.

117
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,980
And then there's a number of other species.

118
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,060
A couple of them I had trouble putting a name on, and I was happy to see they were synonymized.

119
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
And the new checklist.

120
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,060
Any of these moths that are colorful, you get a lot of amateurs collecting them.

121
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,160
And amateurs like to have lots of different names for them.

122
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:40,820
And that's why sometimes there's amateur mistakes made, instead of naming them on the basis of careful studies.

123
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,000
But experts make mistakes, too.

124
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,220
Trypanulatrix.

125
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,640
There's going to be several species of trypanulatrix.

126
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,760
I think they all feed on Cianothus.

127
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,900
There was a student in ecology one time, and she came out to Cold Canyon a few times.

128
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:12,200
And her proposed project was to see if there was some type of partitioning of Cianothus so that the various species were not in competition with one another.

129
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you know what she found?

130
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,500
I don't think she survived graduate school.

131
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,620
But I don't remember her name off the top of my head.

132
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:34,540
Shapiro may remember her, but there was one time a former Shapiro student came to a seminar and walked up to Shapiro and shook his hand.

133
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
Shapiro didn't recognize him.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,260
You can tell butterflies apart, but humans are tough.

135
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,140
Wagner told me that he thinks bifilata is more than one species.

136
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,720
But that remains to be seen.

137
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:03,780
He has opinions about a lot of things that, and I don't know what he bases that on, whether it's DNA or, oh, I went the wrong way.

138
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:21,080
But bifilata seems, it can be seen throughout the year.

139
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,400
So maybe more than one generation, I don't know.

140
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,700
Carniaria is another common species.

141
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,640
And some of them are similar to one another.

142
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I can't swear that every one of them was identified correctly, but I did sometimes when I was uncertain about what species they were, dissect them.

143
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,680
Because there is a monograph, which Wagner doesn't think is very good, that has illustrations.

144
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:07,400
And the genitalia at least enables you to assign them to species following the concepts of the author of that earlier.

145
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,240
That was Fred Ringe did that.

146
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,860
And these are identified using the concepts there.

147
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,680
Falcateria is an early flying species, and it has falcate wingtips.

148
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,580
And so it's somewhat easy to identify.

149
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,900
And I don't know that many of these turned up in Davis, but a couple of them did.

150
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,060
Holsteiae, less common.

151
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,360
Monocaria is the other common, is the other one that shows up with some frequency in Davis.

152
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,460
And I get them from early in the year to very late in the year.

153
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,540
So long flights there.

154
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Quadraria is a small species, and there's a name for the western one, a subspecific name for the western ones,

155
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,380
because there is, some of them look very different from the others.

156
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,460
Can I ask you a quick question, Grace?

157
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:19,840
So, for instance, this one is gray here, and it's red there.

158
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,380
My impression was that these colors were based on the modeling of the partial day positives,

159
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,580
which means they should be the same color.

160
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,160
Yeah, it's possible that, because I re-ran the models.

161
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,580
Right, okay, that's what I was wondering.

162
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,100
And my threshold was, like, 75%, so it's possible that this one was, like, 75% decline,

163
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,040
and this one was, like, 74% decline or something.

164
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,480
Got it.

165
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,120
So it switched into a new category.

166
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,000
Perfect.

167
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,220
I just wanted to make sure.

168
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,820
All right.

169
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Luna calcarea is one that I record less often than the others.

170
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,660
Can we have a quick break here, John, so we can restart the recording?
