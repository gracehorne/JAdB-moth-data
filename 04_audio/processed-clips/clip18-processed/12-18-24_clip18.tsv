0	9500	All right, we are recording on December 18, 2024, so it might be good if we kept that information.
10500	12000	And we're ready to go, we're talking about Stubbins.
12660	18160	Ducantistanda is a true ecophore, and it's not one that was split off into depressarity.
18160	36660	It's a kind of yellowish-tan moth with gold spots and bars, so it's easy to recognize, at least in a fresh specimen.
36660	54100	And it was in a different genus, under a different name at one time, and it got split into a few species when they did the ecophore fascicle in the Mona series.
56100	65680	And this is the only species I found at Cold Canyon, and it turns up more frequently on the upper trail.
66660	69400	And that's the West Trail.
70320	74340	And I may be erroneous about this.
74460	87960	It may feed in either rotting wood or old logs, but there, there was a pile of dead wood, and that may have been the source of it being more common.
87960	92220	But I'd have to look up and see what's known about the host plant.
92320	93740	I don't know whether it's been reared.
96660	102740	The next two species in Ducotis are tortricis on oaks.
103900	108300	And what's unusual is Basiplegona and Fragariana.
108460	110340	Usually you have one but not the other.
110900	112900	But here we have both of them at Cold Canyon.
112900	118020	And whether they feed on the same oaks or not, I couldn't tell you.
120320	123320	And they're somewhat similar.
123460	129380	Basiplegona has more orangish on it, where the other one has various tones of gray and black.
129380	137980	But I think that I have recorded most of them accurately.
139780	150900	And this is one, you know, with the oaks having been burned out of Cold Canyon, it may plummet in numbers unless the oaks recover.
150900	152420	That's Diagramma?
152420	154420	The two Ducotis species.
154420	155020	Oh, Ducotis, got it.
159820	164760	Dicorda illustraria is one of those green geometrids.
165440	168460	And this is the largest species there, very distinct.
168460	175380	And it shows up in modest numbers over the years.
177380	184560	Looks like there's a gap here, but I never thought that it disappeared or anything.
189280	191480	Diagrammia californiaria.
191480	198240	All of the Diagrammia species that are somewhat similar to one another.
198700	204960	When the monofascical came out maybe four or five years ago, I did a lot of dissections.
206300	219620	And California area has various forms, but there's kind of a consistent character that enables you to identify it without doing dissections,
219620	221640	regardless of these different forms, regardless of these different forms.
221640	228620	And it makes some dark triangular marks along the leading edge of the forewings.
229500	231780	Leading when the wings are outshed, of course.
234260	238620	Ararada is the one that resembles Neptaria.
240940	247320	And Muscariata went under a couple of names previously.
247320	250420	And this is the one that we're using.
251140	253320	Neptaria is the one like Ararada.
255000	257280	Those plants are listed in that monograph.
258120	261320	I think all the species are native species.
262520	269140	But Nepensis is on conifers.
269140	272300	And it's in Davis, where there's no native conifers.
272300	285880	So it seems to either be naturally exploiting exotic plantings or it's getting introduced with them.
285880	289520	It's a Plymelata.
291640	292480	He's on willow.
292560	293380	I know that one.
293880	300820	And it used to be confused with another species.
300820	307320	And so in the early annual spreadseats, it's listed as aerobescence.
308820	314560	And one of the paratypes is from Cold Canyon.
314560	318560	And so we know that's a good one.
322240	331100	Diaryctria 4-di is a Pyrrolid in the Fisotines.
331100	337100	And it feeds on Pinus sabiniana.
337540	347780	And it's a large Diaryctria and very distinct from Muricae tivorella and the ones that resemble Muricae tivorella.
348180	350180	And I'll discuss that one next.
350180	359380	Recently, there was a paper that described some new species of Diaryctria with very subtle differences in genitalia.
359960	366460	And I have not re-examined to see whether what we're calling Fordi is one of the new species.
366960	370860	But Fordi was described from Mount Diablo, I believe.
371580	377380	And Mount Diablo, Cold Canyon is in an extension of what they call the Diablo Range.
377380	383940	So I think this is probably the right, the correct name of the species there.
384280	392640	But in any event, they're all distinct from the other Diaryctria, which is not the case for Muricae tivorella.
393960	407140	Muricae tivorella has kind of, it's various tones of gray and white and black.
407380	413700	Like many Fisotine pyrella feeds on conifers.
414000	418540	Muricae tivorella is Monterey pine.
418920	425580	But obviously there's no native Monterey pine in Cold Canyon.
425580	427240	Oh, goodness.
428080	430780	But it probably feeds on other pines as well.
433440	441720	And some of the ones that I called Muricae tivorella do have blurred patterns.
441720	445040	And I think that's a good name for them, where other ones don't.
445040	452680	And the key character that was given in the monograph that includes Diaryctria says raised scales on the forewings.
452680	461340	So with raised scales, they're AB, AB tivorella, Feeson, ABs.
461340	476820	And I think that raised scale character is not reliable, partially because they might get mashed flat or they get abraded.
476820	488500	So I'm not certain that everything that I've called Muricae tivorella or AB tivorella have been correctly identified.
488500	492520	So there's a problem there.
492700	498060	But AB tivorella seems to have a wide range of conifers as hosts.
498460	502020	Are they all listed under here, both the AB tivorella?
502020	507500	Well, the two that are similar, Muricae tivorella and AB tivorella,
507500	514940	I have, from time to time, combined them and then split them.
515680	526080	Okay, so AB tivorella might just be below the threshold of, like the number of sightings might be below the threshold of what we're seeing?
526080	535460	Or you used a version, which was before I decided to, before I tried to split them into two species.
535460	538560	The problem is, you know, I don't save every specimen that I collect.
539100	545880	But I think anything where there's a strong possibility of confusion,
545880	557800	if you analyze them as a single species, I think you need to annotate that there's a possibility that it includes more than one species.
558300	565160	Because the dynamics of those two species could be competitive.
565460	568220	Or it could be independent of one another.
569380	573500	So I don't know how specific Muricae tivorella is.
573580	577920	Obviously, it's not just a Monterey pine, because there's no Monterey pine out there.
577920	585200	And most of the pines here in Davis, which, where we get ones that mostly look like AB tivorella,
585920	592420	are, you know, like Italian stone pine and things like that.
592520	597520	So they're not even U.S. native species.
597520	603080	I just confirmed that they're not combined in the data set.
603280	603680	They're separate.
604880	605400	Okay.
605580	606280	Yeah, we'll deal with it.
606740	609620	There's another species there called Orantiaca.
609620	614460	And I would think that there was enough records of that, but it's not here.
615580	625840	And that one looks, it's rather than being, it's still a mottled moth, but it's kind of a rusty brown looking pattern.
626020	627720	It's rusty brown in coloration.
627980	629960	So it looks different than both these.
630380	633260	Fordi has brown on it, as well as blacks and grays.
633460	633620	Okay.
633620	637020	Plus, it's so much bigger than the other ones.
637100	638040	It's easy to identify.
638040	638740	So it's distinct, yeah, okay.
640520	641140	Got it.
643660	651180	Drasteria edler's eye is the most common of the several moths in that genus that I've collected at Gold Canyon.
652080	657960	And adults can be seen active during the day, as well as at night.
657960	669400	These are sometimes called false underwings because they're not Cotacola like the other, like true underwings.
669720	672200	But they do have colorful hindwings.
673340	680300	And they tend to be mostly smaller than all the Cotacola species.
680300	690180	And Edward's eye, Edward's Z eye, is the most common species by far.
691300	695140	And as I said, you see it active during the day.
695800	700060	It has a long flight season, so there might be multiple generations.
700520	701380	But it's hard to know.
703360	705540	Palisans is the second most common one.
705540	715060	And this one has a white underwing, whereas Edward's eye is kind of a deep yellow-orange hindwing.
717140	724700	Again, with those black markings similar to on a Cotacola true underwing.
725440	727980	And then there's a number of other species.
728100	735060	A couple of them I had trouble putting a name on, and I was happy to see they were synonymized.
735540	736740	And the new checklist.
738960	746060	Any of these moths that are colorful, you get a lot of amateurs collecting them.
746060	750160	And amateurs like to have lots of different names for them.
750380	760820	And that's why sometimes there's amateur mistakes made, instead of naming them on the basis of careful studies.
762120	764000	But experts make mistakes, too.
765540	767220	Trypanulatrix.
767340	769640	There's going to be several species of trypanulatrix.
769780	771760	I think they all feed on Cianothus.
772440	776900	There was a student in ecology one time, and she came out to Cold Canyon a few times.
776900	792200	And her proposed project was to see if there was some type of partitioning of Cianothus so that the various species were not in competition with one another.
792200	794000	Do you know what she found?
794620	798500	I don't think she survived graduate school.
798780	803620	But I don't remember her name off the top of my head.
803880	814540	Shapiro may remember her, but there was one time a former Shapiro student came to a seminar and walked up to Shapiro and shook his hand.
815240	816640	Shapiro didn't recognize him.
816640	821260	You can tell butterflies apart, but humans are tough.
825940	830140	Wagner told me that he thinks bifilata is more than one species.
830140	834720	But that remains to be seen.
834800	843780	He has opinions about a lot of things that, and I don't know what he bases that on, whether it's DNA or, oh, I went the wrong way.
843780	861080	But bifilata seems, it can be seen throughout the year.
861320	865400	So maybe more than one generation, I don't know.
865400	869700	Carniaria is another common species.
873700	876640	And some of them are similar to one another.
876640	890640	I can't swear that every one of them was identified correctly, but I did sometimes when I was uncertain about what species they were, dissect them.
890880	897680	Because there is a monograph, which Wagner doesn't think is very good, that has illustrations.
897680	907400	And the genitalia at least enables you to assign them to species following the concepts of the author of that earlier.
908600	910240	That was Fred Ringe did that.
910740	914860	And these are identified using the concepts there.
915440	920680	Falcateria is an early flying species, and it has falcate wingtips.
920680	925580	And so it's somewhat easy to identify.
926080	930900	And I don't know that many of these turned up in Davis, but a couple of them did.
933340	936060	Holsteiae, less common.
940260	945360	Monocaria is the other common, is the other one that shows up with some frequency in Davis.
946140	949460	And I get them from early in the year to very late in the year.
949460	952540	So long flights there.
953320	961840	Quadraria is a small species, and there's a name for the western one, a subspecific name for the western ones,
961980	966380	because there is, some of them look very different from the others.
969680	971460	Can I ask you a quick question, Grace?
971460	979840	So, for instance, this one is gray here, and it's red there.
981360	987380	My impression was that these colors were based on the modeling of the partial day positives,
987880	989580	which means they should be the same color.
990260	994160	Yeah, it's possible that, because I re-ran the models.
994360	995580	Right, okay, that's what I was wondering.
995580	1002100	And my threshold was, like, 75%, so it's possible that this one was, like, 75% decline,
1002280	1005040	and this one was, like, 74% decline or something.
1005200	1005480	Got it.
1005480	1007120	So it switched into a new category.
1007700	1008000	Perfect.
1008240	1009220	I just wanted to make sure.
1010440	1010820	All right.
1011280	1015000	Luna calcarea is one that I record less often than the others.
1015000	1021660	Can we have a quick break here, John, so we can restart the recording?
