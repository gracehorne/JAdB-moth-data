WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.500
All right, we are recording on December 18, 2024, so it might be good if we kept that information.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.000
And we're ready to go, we're talking about Stubbins.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.160
Ducantistanda is a true ecophore, and it's not one that was split off into depressarity.

00:18.160 --> 00:36.660
It's a kind of yellowish-tan moth with gold spots and bars, so it's easy to recognize, at least in a fresh specimen.

00:36.660 --> 00:54.100
And it was in a different genus, under a different name at one time, and it got split into a few species when they did the ecophore fascicle in the Mona series.

00:56.100 --> 01:05.680
And this is the only species I found at Cold Canyon, and it turns up more frequently on the upper trail.

01:06.660 --> 01:09.400
And that's the West Trail.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.340
And I may be erroneous about this.

01:14.460 --> 01:27.960
It may feed in either rotting wood or old logs, but there, there was a pile of dead wood, and that may have been the source of it being more common.

01:27.960 --> 01:32.220
But I'd have to look up and see what's known about the host plant.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.740
I don't know whether it's been reared.

01:36.660 --> 01:42.740
The next two species in Ducotis are tortricis on oaks.

01:43.900 --> 01:48.300
And what's unusual is Basiplegona and Fragariana.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.340
Usually you have one but not the other.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.900
But here we have both of them at Cold Canyon.

01:52.900 --> 01:58.020
And whether they feed on the same oaks or not, I couldn't tell you.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.320
And they're somewhat similar.

02:03.460 --> 02:09.380
Basiplegona has more orangish on it, where the other one has various tones of gray and black.

02:09.380 --> 02:17.980
But I think that I have recorded most of them accurately.

02:19.780 --> 02:30.900
And this is one, you know, with the oaks having been burned out of Cold Canyon, it may plummet in numbers unless the oaks recover.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.420
That's Diagramma?

02:32.420 --> 02:34.420
The two Ducotis species.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.020
Oh, Ducotis, got it.

02:39.820 --> 02:44.760
Dicorda illustraria is one of those green geometrids.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.460
And this is the largest species there, very distinct.

02:48.460 --> 02:55.380
And it shows up in modest numbers over the years.

02:57.380 --> 03:04.560
Looks like there's a gap here, but I never thought that it disappeared or anything.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.480
Diagrammia californiaria.

03:11.480 --> 03:18.240
All of the Diagrammia species that are somewhat similar to one another.

03:18.700 --> 03:24.960
When the monofascical came out maybe four or five years ago, I did a lot of dissections.

03:26.300 --> 03:39.620
And California area has various forms, but there's kind of a consistent character that enables you to identify it without doing dissections,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.640
regardless of these different forms, regardless of these different forms.

03:41.640 --> 03:48.620
And it makes some dark triangular marks along the leading edge of the forewings.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.780
Leading when the wings are outshed, of course.

03:54.260 --> 03:58.620
Ararada is the one that resembles Neptaria.

04:00.940 --> 04:07.320
And Muscariata went under a couple of names previously.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.420
And this is the one that we're using.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.320
Neptaria is the one like Ararada.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.280
Those plants are listed in that monograph.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.320
I think all the species are native species.

04:22.520 --> 04:29.140
But Nepensis is on conifers.

04:29.140 --> 04:32.300
And it's in Davis, where there's no native conifers.

04:32.300 --> 04:45.880
So it seems to either be naturally exploiting exotic plantings or it's getting introduced with them.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.520
It's a Plymelata.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.480
He's on willow.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.380
I know that one.

04:53.880 --> 05:00.820
And it used to be confused with another species.

05:00.820 --> 05:07.320
And so in the early annual spreadseats, it's listed as aerobescence.

05:08.820 --> 05:14.560
And one of the paratypes is from Cold Canyon.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.560
And so we know that's a good one.

05:22.240 --> 05:31.100
Diaryctria 4-di is a Pyrrolid in the Fisotines.

05:31.100 --> 05:37.100
And it feeds on Pinus sabiniana.

05:37.540 --> 05:47.780
And it's a large Diaryctria and very distinct from Muricae tivorella and the ones that resemble Muricae tivorella.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.180
And I'll discuss that one next.

05:50.180 --> 05:59.380
Recently, there was a paper that described some new species of Diaryctria with very subtle differences in genitalia.

05:59.960 --> 06:06.460
And I have not re-examined to see whether what we're calling Fordi is one of the new species.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.860
But Fordi was described from Mount Diablo, I believe.

06:11.580 --> 06:17.380
And Mount Diablo, Cold Canyon is in an extension of what they call the Diablo Range.

06:17.380 --> 06:23.940
So I think this is probably the right, the correct name of the species there.

06:24.280 --> 06:32.640
But in any event, they're all distinct from the other Diaryctria, which is not the case for Muricae tivorella.

06:33.960 --> 06:47.140
Muricae tivorella has kind of, it's various tones of gray and white and black.

06:47.380 --> 06:53.700
Like many Fisotine pyrella feeds on conifers.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.540
Muricae tivorella is Monterey pine.

06:58.920 --> 07:05.580
But obviously there's no native Monterey pine in Cold Canyon.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.240
Oh, goodness.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.780
But it probably feeds on other pines as well.

07:13.440 --> 07:21.720
And some of the ones that I called Muricae tivorella do have blurred patterns.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.040
And I think that's a good name for them, where other ones don't.

07:25.040 --> 07:32.680
And the key character that was given in the monograph that includes Diaryctria says raised scales on the forewings.

07:32.680 --> 07:41.340
So with raised scales, they're AB, AB tivorella, Feeson, ABs.

07:41.340 --> 07:56.820
And I think that raised scale character is not reliable, partially because they might get mashed flat or they get abraded.

07:56.820 --> 08:08.500
So I'm not certain that everything that I've called Muricae tivorella or AB tivorella have been correctly identified.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.520
So there's a problem there.

08:12.700 --> 08:18.060
But AB tivorella seems to have a wide range of conifers as hosts.

08:18.460 --> 08:22.020
Are they all listed under here, both the AB tivorella?

08:22.020 --> 08:27.500
Well, the two that are similar, Muricae tivorella and AB tivorella,

08:27.500 --> 08:34.940
I have, from time to time, combined them and then split them.

08:35.680 --> 08:46.080
Okay, so AB tivorella might just be below the threshold of, like the number of sightings might be below the threshold of what we're seeing?

08:46.080 --> 08:55.460
Or you used a version, which was before I decided to, before I tried to split them into two species.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.560
The problem is, you know, I don't save every specimen that I collect.

08:59.100 --> 09:05.880
But I think anything where there's a strong possibility of confusion,

09:05.880 --> 09:17.800
if you analyze them as a single species, I think you need to annotate that there's a possibility that it includes more than one species.

09:18.300 --> 09:25.160
Because the dynamics of those two species could be competitive.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.220
Or it could be independent of one another.

09:29.380 --> 09:33.500
So I don't know how specific Muricae tivorella is.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.920
Obviously, it's not just a Monterey pine, because there's no Monterey pine out there.

09:37.920 --> 09:45.200
And most of the pines here in Davis, which, where we get ones that mostly look like AB tivorella,

09:45.920 --> 09:52.420
are, you know, like Italian stone pine and things like that.

09:52.520 --> 09:57.520
So they're not even U.S. native species.

09:57.520 --> 10:03.080
I just confirmed that they're not combined in the data set.

10:03.280 --> 10:03.680
They're separate.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.400
Okay.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.280
Yeah, we'll deal with it.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.620
There's another species there called Orantiaca.

10:09.620 --> 10:14.460
And I would think that there was enough records of that, but it's not here.

10:15.580 --> 10:25.840
And that one looks, it's rather than being, it's still a mottled moth, but it's kind of a rusty brown looking pattern.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.720
It's rusty brown in coloration.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.960
So it looks different than both these.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.260
Fordi has brown on it, as well as blacks and grays.

10:33.460 --> 10:33.620
Okay.

10:33.620 --> 10:37.020
Plus, it's so much bigger than the other ones.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.040
It's easy to identify.

10:38.040 --> 10:38.740
So it's distinct, yeah, okay.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.140
Got it.

10:43.660 --> 10:51.180
Drasteria edler's eye is the most common of the several moths in that genus that I've collected at Gold Canyon.

10:52.080 --> 10:57.960
And adults can be seen active during the day, as well as at night.

10:57.960 --> 11:09.400
These are sometimes called false underwings because they're not Cotacola like the other, like true underwings.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.200
But they do have colorful hindwings.

11:13.340 --> 11:20.300
And they tend to be mostly smaller than all the Cotacola species.

11:20.300 --> 11:30.180
And Edward's eye, Edward's Z eye, is the most common species by far.

11:31.300 --> 11:35.140
And as I said, you see it active during the day.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.060
It has a long flight season, so there might be multiple generations.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.380
But it's hard to know.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.540
Palisans is the second most common one.

11:45.540 --> 11:55.060
And this one has a white underwing, whereas Edward's eye is kind of a deep yellow-orange hindwing.

11:57.140 --> 12:04.700
Again, with those black markings similar to on a Cotacola true underwing.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.980
And then there's a number of other species.

12:08.100 --> 12:15.060
A couple of them I had trouble putting a name on, and I was happy to see they were synonymized.

12:15.540 --> 12:16.740
And the new checklist.

12:18.960 --> 12:26.060
Any of these moths that are colorful, you get a lot of amateurs collecting them.

12:26.060 --> 12:30.160
And amateurs like to have lots of different names for them.

12:30.380 --> 12:40.820
And that's why sometimes there's amateur mistakes made, instead of naming them on the basis of careful studies.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.000
But experts make mistakes, too.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.220
Trypanulatrix.

12:47.340 --> 12:49.640
There's going to be several species of trypanulatrix.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.760
I think they all feed on Cianothus.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.900
There was a student in ecology one time, and she came out to Cold Canyon a few times.

12:56.900 --> 13:12.200
And her proposed project was to see if there was some type of partitioning of Cianothus so that the various species were not in competition with one another.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.000
Do you know what she found?

13:14.620 --> 13:18.500
I don't think she survived graduate school.

13:18.780 --> 13:23.620
But I don't remember her name off the top of my head.

13:23.880 --> 13:34.540
Shapiro may remember her, but there was one time a former Shapiro student came to a seminar and walked up to Shapiro and shook his hand.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.640
Shapiro didn't recognize him.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.260
You can tell butterflies apart, but humans are tough.

13:45.940 --> 13:50.140
Wagner told me that he thinks bifilata is more than one species.

13:50.140 --> 13:54.720
But that remains to be seen.

13:54.800 --> 14:03.780
He has opinions about a lot of things that, and I don't know what he bases that on, whether it's DNA or, oh, I went the wrong way.

14:03.780 --> 14:21.080
But bifilata seems, it can be seen throughout the year.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.400
So maybe more than one generation, I don't know.

14:25.400 --> 14:29.700
Carniaria is another common species.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.640
And some of them are similar to one another.

14:36.640 --> 14:50.640
I can't swear that every one of them was identified correctly, but I did sometimes when I was uncertain about what species they were, dissect them.

14:50.880 --> 14:57.680
Because there is a monograph, which Wagner doesn't think is very good, that has illustrations.

14:57.680 --> 15:07.400
And the genitalia at least enables you to assign them to species following the concepts of the author of that earlier.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.240
That was Fred Ringe did that.

15:10.740 --> 15:14.860
And these are identified using the concepts there.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.680
Falcateria is an early flying species, and it has falcate wingtips.

15:20.680 --> 15:25.580
And so it's somewhat easy to identify.

15:26.080 --> 15:30.900
And I don't know that many of these turned up in Davis, but a couple of them did.

15:33.340 --> 15:36.060
Holsteiae, less common.

15:40.260 --> 15:45.360
Monocaria is the other common, is the other one that shows up with some frequency in Davis.

15:46.140 --> 15:49.460
And I get them from early in the year to very late in the year.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.540
So long flights there.

15:53.320 --> 16:01.840
Quadraria is a small species, and there's a name for the western one, a subspecific name for the western ones,

16:01.980 --> 16:06.380
because there is, some of them look very different from the others.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.460
Can I ask you a quick question, Grace?

16:11.460 --> 16:19.840
So, for instance, this one is gray here, and it's red there.

16:21.360 --> 16:27.380
My impression was that these colors were based on the modeling of the partial day positives,

16:27.880 --> 16:29.580
which means they should be the same color.

16:30.260 --> 16:34.160
Yeah, it's possible that, because I re-ran the models.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.580
Right, okay, that's what I was wondering.

16:35.580 --> 16:42.100
And my threshold was, like, 75%, so it's possible that this one was, like, 75% decline,

16:42.280 --> 16:45.040
and this one was, like, 74% decline or something.

16:45.200 --> 16:45.480
Got it.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.120
So it switched into a new category.

16:47.700 --> 16:48.000
Perfect.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.220
I just wanted to make sure.

16:50.440 --> 16:50.820
All right.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.000
Luna calcarea is one that I record less often than the others.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.660
Can we have a quick break here, John, so we can restart the recording?
