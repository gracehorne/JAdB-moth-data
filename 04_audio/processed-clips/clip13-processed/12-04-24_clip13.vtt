WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Yeah, anyway, I trust you to make all the decisions as far as the modeling and so forth.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Awesome. Yeah, it's great to hear that.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
I'll give you some feedback, but, you know, it's not really criticism.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
It's just something to consider.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
In general, I want to give you feedback if it's something that pops out like that.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Yeah.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Correct me on these other situations with the name and quotation marks,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
it means that they used to have this terminology,

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
and certainly, in Latin, which means uncertain placement.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
These are ones where this is where they currently reside,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
and those are probably wrong.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
But the correct assignment is up for grads, or there's no correct assignment.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, I think we're reading this one.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
This one, Crepe on Nana, for the longest time, I couldn't put a name on it.

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
And Tim McCabe, who's with New York State Department of Agriculture, had a girlfriend who used to work in the lab that I did before.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
But he'd come out here from time to time, and he collected at Cold Canyon once when he was out there.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And he sent me a list of the species that he caught.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And a lot of them, he used names that I wasn't using.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And one of them was Crepe in Nana.

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
And Ron Robertson, who was my natural specialist before him, thought it was a new species.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
He was able to identify it on the basis of genitalia as a Crepe.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
But it was not a species that he knew, so he thought it was a new species.

01:58.000 --> 02:09.000
And what is called Crepe in Nana, in our collection, in our collection, doesn't look very much like the specimens that I get called candy.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
And this is a fairly common lot, even though there's a lot of zero in this here.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
But it does look like pictures of what's called Danna on a line.

02:22.000 --> 02:38.000
It does resemble pictures of Nana on a line.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
And because Tim McCain, who doesn't communicate very much, gave me that name.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And that's what I decided to call him.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So I'm pretty comfortable with that name now.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I know nothing about the line.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Crepe in Oklahoma.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Crepe in Oklahoma.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
I think it's one that they didn't have pictures on a lot of photographers.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
This is kind of a hard mock to identify.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And I think the name is correct.

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
This is what Ron Robertson thought it was, so I attributed it to him.

03:21.000 --> 03:37.000
You know, for any species that you choose to discuss individually, I, in general, recorded who gave me the identification.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
And that's on a label in the unitary in the synoptic collection.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
So we can shift the blame for being somebody else who can think for that.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Sounds good.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
какие25

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Exitelia, this was recently addressed.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
Have you decided it doesn't fit the current definition of Exitelia.

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
You know, historically there were various groups among that were divided, and further divided, and further divided.

04:14.000 --> 04:23.000
There's nobody worse than taxonomists for pigeonholing things, except maybe ecologists.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Ecologists need to find terms all the time.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
These are general terms.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And they say, well, I don't equate this.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I think the new term is .

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And the same thing happens.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So, you know, with butterflies, it's gotten ridiculous.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
So that now there's almost as many general species.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
The problem is you start obscuring the relationships.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I don't know which general are related to the others.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I think we need to bring back.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You know, there's not enough caterpillars.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
That's part of the problem.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, they get out of the .

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
The grandosal is a very conspicuous moth.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So if I collected it as correct .

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yes.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Very conspicuous.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Right.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You know what would be helpful?

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
And you've shown the document is using one or another checklist number.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Because then you could just end in the checklist number and reference it back through the species.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Because the names will change with the checklist number and something like it will change.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Right.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
I'll just say recommendation in the future if there's something like this.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
This is a very, I think it's, the pattern is very distinct.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Even though it's a small moth.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I can't use it.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
There may be a similar species, but I don't think it's a .

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not correct with this one.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Olivia de Vesta.

06:05.000 --> 06:18.000
Originally I had it under some other genus, the name of which escapes me at the moment.

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
And it's kind of a, I hate this here, cherries to use it all the time.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Nondescript.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
If you describe something that's nondescript, that's kind of an oxymoron.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
But this is a nondescript.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
It's not one that pops out.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.000
So it's one that's hard to sight ID identified by faces of the image.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
Because there's nothing obviously distinctive about it.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So until you've collected them over and over and over again, you don't recognize it.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
But all of these nondescript forms are ones that have a greater probability of being

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
numerologically recorded.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
And I think that's an important point to me.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Orthodes, quote, no, Burka.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
I think it was in Polian report on the genus.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
And I don't have the concept of what that is on my head.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And I'm surprised at the call point that I collected it often enough to be on here.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
If I don't know what it is.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And it's one that I don't recollect collecting very much.

07:41.000 --> 07:55.000
I think what I should do is print out five copies of at least the five-month-old life.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah, I don't know.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
It's kind of.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
But that's what I was calling nondescript.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
You know, if I was saying, well, what do you look for to identify that?

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And I would have to say, properly identify .

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I mean, that's the value of the synaptic collection.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Because you don't have to look through everything.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Bill Patterson, you know, right?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Before we had my photographic group, we'd come in here.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
He'd go through drill after drill after drill after drill after drill.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And then over and over again.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
That's a lot of work.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Absolutely.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
So that would make it hard for him to give up his collection.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
But he's not doing too well.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So he has an enormous butterfly collection.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
And that was the last part of his collection that easily changed.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
We used to find that before figuring out.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Arizona.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Recently, I just redefined Arizona.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
But it's always been in Arizona, but not .

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
And this is a somewhat distinctive chain lecture.

09:13.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't know too much about, I don't know very much about the life history.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
But in general, I turned it not to look up the life histories of macros.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
It was one of the other students of macros.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Okay.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Avigrotus.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Avigrotus.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
We have one, two, three that you included.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
But there's some other species that you didn't include.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Avigrotus.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
No, you included just two of them.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
I thought I had a box full of Avigrotus unidentified.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
And I couldn't find it.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, I was rummaging around and I found it.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
And it turned out that there's only four remaining that I couldn't identify.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
After I had done some dissection.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
So there's four that I would likely dissect.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
But that probably won't change things very much for you.

10:12.000 --> 10:22.000
And I thought that there were some other species that were common enough to be included using the criteria that I'm not sure.

10:22.000 --> 10:37.000
Malauri is very similar to a larger species with a more southerly distribution according to the monograph that includes the genus.

10:37.000 --> 10:50.000
However, a lot of Southern California laws do extend a lot farther to the north than anybody thought in the valley and in the foothills.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
But there hasn't been a lot of collectors who have stuff.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
And collectors go to places that are cool.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
The flashy places.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:15.000
So I did have a couple of larger specimens of what looks like balauri.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And the genitalia of balauri.

11:17.000 --> 11:27.000
And the southern species, the name of which escapes me right now.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
And I retain here that it's deceptive and looks like balauri.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
It could be that balauri is a mixture of the species.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And it could be that there's a species.

11:40.000 --> 11:57.000
La Fontaine, who could the fascicle on the non-cturus, at least this group of non-cturus, the non-cturus, is a splitter.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
So if they can find a reason to call one species, too, it's going to be two.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
Chagonia is a smaller species of amigrotus.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
And I think the females are dark brown and the males are light brown or the other way around.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I can't remember.

12:22.000 --> 12:34.000
But it's unusual in that in most of the nocturus, in this genus of related genera,

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
the tip of the female abdomen is kind of flattened.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
And the male abdomen is rounded all the way to the apex.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, this one, the female, is also rounded to the apex.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
So you have to look a little closer to tell whether it's a male or female.

12:55.000 --> 13:06.000
And there's another small species called canyon, which, if you looked at the distribution map,

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
and the monofascicles shouldn't be there.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
But I just have to remember what it looks like, but it shouldn't be.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, the distribution map's there.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
We're only at the specimens of the museum.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
And after I, eventually I got both sepsis of it and it's a good match.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
But amigrotus is a difficult change because a lot of the, there's a few distinct species,

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
but there's a lot of them that are similar to one or several other species.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
So there are pairs or groups of species that are very similar to one another.

13:51.000 --> 14:01.000
And when you're deceptive and you know what's in your memory and intention,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
you're supposed to be in the one another again.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
But every once in a while there's a possibility that something's real about it.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Unless you're alert for it, you listen.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
And Surin and Arnalis is a very distinctive species.

14:16.000 --> 14:25.000
I love to, flies, late winter, early spring.

14:25.000 --> 14:35.000
So every specimen that I collected has been recorded.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
The Chira Occidentalis, you know, we discussed the Chira before.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Ran Talvis is the one that's more widely distributed.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
I think it's the one that's more widely distributed.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
I think Occidentalis has a common name, but it may be the other one, I'm not sure.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
I've not caught the ones that are called Ran Talis at Cope Canyon, or very seldom have caught them there,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
whereas Ran Talis seems to be the dominant species in Davis.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
And I've done a few dissections, but not a lot.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't know, I'd have to look to see whether I recorded NES or E or O.

15:22.000 --> 15:34.000
But I don't think it would be proper if you're going to analyze them to combine the two together and insert the new model,

15:34.000 --> 15:42.000
because I think they have very different types of books, ranges, and biologians, and so forth.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And that's the Dender, where they're combined spaces,

15:45.000 --> 15:56.000
and through obscuring the patterns of each component of the combination.

15:56.000 --> 16:08.000
Clarice Foley and the Tarchessa that feeds on the Mountain Mahogany.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
And this is always a scientific name, because...

16:14.000 --> 16:28.000
I have to do like a Heimlich maneuver to my brain to spurn out.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Arcane.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
It's the Mountain Mahogany, you know, Shepard Hill.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
So it kind of comes, it goes, this is what it'll probably be.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
You know, it might be better after fire, because...

16:52.000 --> 17:02.000
There's not a lot of circle carcass like cocaine, and most of it is on the west faces, sort of,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
and not on the bottom floor, or on the east.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
So not in the places where I put them off that surround.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And the...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I can look at it a lot of them.

17:13.000 --> 17:28.000
The Acrobasis Collisionella is quite difficult to tell apart by faces from Acrobasis...

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
...concilla.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Concilla.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Got it.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
They'll stay on oaks.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Males are easy to tell apart because they have an antenna character.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Right.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Let's say they're present or absent.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But it's always absent on the females, so they're a little bit harder apart.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
But once you separate them, you know, and you have a series of them, you can map them.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You're no longer new to.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
But I mention that because there's quite a high probability that I have misidentified collisionella,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
or confused collisionella with Comptella.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
So the numbers of both could be wrong.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Mm-hmm.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
But they're both suspicious.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
They behave fairly near once.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
If you want to turn sorry about Bill Patterson's before the...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
...if you do, you do, you do, you do.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
He said, oh, you know, now they look different.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
They're separate.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
You know.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
He looked at them.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
He's really good.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I couldn't tell.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
The stuff couldn't tell the difference.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
But I can see it.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You know.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
But it's hard sometimes to put into words.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
What it is.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
The things that we can see initially.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Like I could solve it on them.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Pecker makes a struggle now on the other hand.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Who knows?

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Very different from the other two.

18:58.000 --> 19:09.000
And as I mentioned, at Colcannon, it seems to be on Toyah more than anything.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
And if I recall correctly, and it's always a danger, it plasters together a couple of leaves

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
and it's found in kind of a silken shelter.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
So it doesn't roll the leaves anymore.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
It just kind of plasters two together.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
So it sees their numbers on to other leaves.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And they're, you get it throughout the year.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So there's probably more than that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
The other generation.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Of course, the ones on oak.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So they're just a central generation.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Probably because of the tannins of oak.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Makes it unpalatable.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Much of the year.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
This acrolophic green genus movie.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
Acrolophidae has been treated as a family from time to time, but also as a son family.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
And that's how it's treated in New Checkers.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
So it's an acrolofine in a way.

20:16.000 --> 20:26.000
And I sent this to a specialist who is, they wanted to have a monophacical, but it probably won't be published.

20:26.000 --> 20:36.000
Because all the models are kind of mousy-bound looking and look very much like one another.

20:36.000 --> 20:53.000
And the exception between this and the other species, which are currently in the genus imagery, and there's two at Cold Canyon, is obvious.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
This one, you look at the palpi, and the palpi are very different than the two that are in the genus imagery.

20:58.000 --> 21:14.000
But the specialists who are doing the monochemists have decided that the two that are currently in the genus are in two different genera.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.000
But I don't know that those two genera are differentiated on the basis of external characters or not.

21:24.000 --> 21:36.000
With that said, all of the new genus, new species, are probably recorded and recorded as new genus, new species.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
Whereas all of the amygia-like ones are recorded as one or the other.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
And the ones that were recorded as one or the other were the ones that the specialists examined.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
And all the others, I'm not going to disser.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
He had a way of just teasing on them.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
He could see things externally that would tell him whether they were one or the other.

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
After he teased on some of the hairline scales on the tip of the abdomen of both men and men,

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
and he tried to describe it to me that, you know, without saying it under high magnification,

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
he didn't have the ability to do it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I couldn't have sold that.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
And so I've just been recorded in this year or...

22:23.000 --> 22:35.000
But he told me that there's probably another species here that was not among the dozens of specialists that I have done with them.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
He's one of those rare cases where you send something else to a specialist

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
and the turnaround time is weeks rather than years.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh, wow.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
He came back and everyone has a lot of family.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
Probably because he's an amateur or other professional.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Acrolophus, careful.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Acrolophus is another acrolophus.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Acrolophus, fine.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And the tropics, these are...

23:07.000 --> 23:17.000
A lot of the species have labial palates that come up and curve back well beyond the back of the head.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Wow.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
But the ones we have out here are shorter though.

23:21.000 --> 23:30.000
They don't have those enormous recurred labial palates.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
Tear file items are larger species than it is the other one, Latta Capitania.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
And I got it for the first time in my backyard this year.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
No records before.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I've never caught Latta Capitania in my backyard.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And Latta Capitania is the very colony that called Penny.

23:49.000 --> 24:01.000
Do you remember that night that we went out and I forgot to remind you and Emily that we were going to go collect?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That night was so windy.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
We only got it out for a moment.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, in my life.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
No.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
But I think almost all the moss that we collected that night were acrolophus by the Capitania.

24:12.000 --> 24:25.000
And these species, I don't know too much about the biology, but the acrolophus that are in the nutria, I think, are associated with rotent burrows.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
That sort of situation.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
And these may get an animal habitat as well.

24:34.000 --> 24:47.000
You know, they're related to canelias and a lot of the canelias are female characters and hairs and horny materials and so forth.

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
So, you know, a good classification is allowing you to make certain predictions about the biology.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I don't know.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
You know, I don't know.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's easy, but it breaks down in some degrees.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
It's a specimen maybe.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
You can't do it.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
And the fichita was my two or two.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Acronecta.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't know which one.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
I originally recorded Acronecta infleda.

25:21.000 --> 25:32.000
to it. It has two species, Impita and Impressa. So in some of the old spreadsheets, you see

25:32.000 --> 25:42.000
both names. And there recently was a Mona, a classical donor. But Jeff, somebody had

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
borrowed all the material before and that person never worked on it. And eventually

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
the person who wrote the classical corral of all of those numbers. And there was nothing

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
to compare specimens with, because everybody had known their specimens to this person.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
So that was like plotting them.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
So based on some photographs that I have, I thought they were just

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
variations of white species. And it turns out that Impita is much larger than Impressa

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
on that basis alone. But we had accumulated material here in the

26:30.000 --> 26:37.000
that were not seen by the person who did the monograph. And Jeff sent him photographs

26:37.000 --> 26:46.000
and he was able to identify strictly on the basis of photographs. And now that we have

26:46.000 --> 26:56.000
a good reference, I think everything is correct. And I made errors. And I think most of these are

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
somewhat generous on trees and shrubs.

27:03.000 --> 27:13.000
You know, that's why he's not raised. He's full of information. He gets a little cranky about

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
sharing it with other people from time to time. If he knows that you're going to use it

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
rather than you're just curious.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
I talked to him just recently. He's making noise about retiring once it gets.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Oh, interesting.

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
Acronecta marmorata is the most common one. And we get it here in Davis. The other two species I've not seen in Davis.

27:40.000 --> 27:55.000
In Marmorata, I think it's fairly widespread. And I think it probably in Davis is an oak moth. And it may be an oak moth in general.

27:55.000 --> 28:07.000
Acronecta prodita is a very dark species with a white hindrance. So it's fairly easy to recognize.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
And it's fairly easy to recognize.

28:11.000 --> 28:24.000
The delphagrotus indeterminata we discussed in Davis. But again, early specimens might have been confused with what I was

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
calling .

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Until that fascicle came out.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
There's another species of the delphagrotus indeterminata in Southern California that I keep looking for because

28:34.000 --> 28:36.760
in Southern California that I keep looking for,

28:36.760 --> 28:40.760
because they look the same, except that the deltagrotus

28:40.760 --> 28:44.760
endoterminata has a black prothoracic collar

28:44.760 --> 28:48.240
that looks like the deltagrotus falminus.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.520
Whereas the other one, I think it's called stovirus,

28:52.520 --> 28:58.640
has a pale prothoracic collar.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.560
And there's no reason why that species shouldn't be here,

29:01.560 --> 29:05.320
but I haven't found it, I've never found it.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.560
And I can not direct post-discollar.

29:16.560 --> 29:24.560
This is in the depressority, which used to be a part of it.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.320
Maybe it makes you sad.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.320
They're hard to identify, don't they still think?

29:31.320 --> 29:38.320
It used to be combined with the other decoformers.

29:38.320 --> 29:44.320
There was some family that today, family, decoformers,

29:44.320 --> 29:47.320
decoformers, as it appeared in the previous checklists,

29:47.320 --> 29:53.320
is now at least two families, and I think three.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.320
Three, and maybe four.

29:55.320 --> 30:00.320
So stovat, stovat, stovat, with the other one.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.320
And we don't have that deal.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
So this is the decoformer.

30:04.320 --> 30:10.320
And caterpillars are somewhat easy to find,

30:10.320 --> 30:13.320
because they make shelters, and the shelters are big enough

30:13.320 --> 30:15.320
that you can find them.

30:15.320 --> 30:21.320
Toaster salad feeds on chaperone feed.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
And we don't have to.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.320
And they call it, um.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
And they call it, um.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
And they call it, um.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.320
And they call it, um.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
And they call it, um.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.320
And they're just gonna charge anyway.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.320
And they used to be, I don't know,

30:29.320 --> 30:34.320
it's always showing me crazy how.

30:34.320 --> 30:39.320
What's reaching this now?

30:39.320 --> 30:42.320
I don't know, like, how a creeper is in India.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
Yeah.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.320
Yeah.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.320
Yeah.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.320
Yeah.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.320
Yeah.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.320
Yeah.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.320
Yeah, I guess so.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.320
But it was in something that started with,

30:52.320 --> 30:53.320
I don't know.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.320
Anyway, it was split off.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.320
And one of the species, soralea,

30:58.320 --> 31:01.320
is what it used to be, P-S-O-R-A.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.320
So there's a species of agonoptera.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.320
It's called soralea.

31:05.320 --> 31:09.320
And, um, it's not included here.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.320
But that also feeds on this plant.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.320
And when I heard, um, um, soralea.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.320
Soralea really explodes after fire.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.320
So you would expect it to be more common after fire.

31:22.320 --> 31:26.320
But this species, um,

31:26.320 --> 31:30.320
Rosacella, seems to be fairly common,

31:30.320 --> 31:35.320
regardless of whether it's a year or two after fire or not.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.320
It was far more common than soralea.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.320
But when I collected categories,

31:40.320 --> 31:43.320
I don't think that I was a career with species.

31:43.320 --> 31:47.320
But I did with soralea, which is selenken.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.320
And all the species,

31:50.320 --> 31:56.320
I believe all the species overwintered as adults.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.320
So there's a,

31:57.320 --> 32:00.320
that's why you get them throughout the years.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.320
It's not because of multiple generations.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.320
And like I said, they're flattened.

32:05.320 --> 32:10.320
And that flattening enables them to hide in crevices and so forth.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.320
So there's a reason why they flattened.

32:12.320 --> 32:16.320
And that flattening is very common with overwintering species.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
Oh, no.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
Oh, okay.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
Yeah.

32:19.320 --> 32:24.320
So most of the deepest soralea are flattened that way.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.320
Okay, which line was because ofpełic.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.320
Yes.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.320
Yes.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.320
You know,

32:30.320 --> 32:32.320
youankenixen for Megal Shepherd.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
Okay, what else did you say,

32:34.320 --> 32:35.320
let me just ask.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.320
I didn't ask her if my question is,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.320
how do you actually Henrietta

32:38.320 --> 32:40.320
issue make sure you had that huge data,

32:40.320 --> 32:42.320
what would you make sure you put this really bad pode?

32:42.320 --> 32:43.320
In fact,

32:43.320 --> 32:46.320
I didn't want to risk use all of these species a little bit

32:46.320 --> 32:48.320
here right now.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.320
And then that's like you otra interface

32:49.320 --> 32:50.320
and I got to different些 species here.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.120
And

32:53.120 --> 32:59.620
Davis, where I was really, I used to be excited to get one system, but I think particularly

32:59.620 --> 33:11.520
last year, I don't have that. I got more last year than all other years combined. I just

33:11.520 --> 33:25.520
have this notion that in general, it goes through the long periods, long cycles of, you know, periodic,

33:25.520 --> 33:37.520
and people who work on it, people who always like to attribute it to natural enemies.

33:37.520 --> 33:49.520
But it could be disease, it could be herb creation, spider creation, and the same way.

33:49.520 --> 33:58.520
It was fairly common at the Coal Canyon once I started collecting in those months.

33:58.520 --> 34:10.520
And it has a very consistent pattern, but the brown color is not so consistent.

34:10.520 --> 34:20.520
There are various earth patterns, from yellowish brown, to reddish brown, to chocolate brown,

34:20.520 --> 34:28.520
and various shades of brown. You know, how all cars now seem to be different shades of gray.

34:28.520 --> 34:32.520
I hate it. I'm looking like a navy here.

34:32.520 --> 34:46.520
I brought this ipsilon that I talked about in Davis. It has some little black dash marks near the wing tips

34:46.520 --> 34:52.520
and it seems to be, you know, they seem to be present, you know, the person who, the one that says,

34:52.520 --> 34:58.520
they seem to be present even on the warm specimens.

34:58.520 --> 35:12.520
Some of them look a little bit like some examples of feltria, subterranea, and also peridermal salsia.

35:12.520 --> 35:18.520
And also it has that kind of bluish shade to the high end.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.520
And feltria always has a white pioneer, so it is.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.520
And then the dashes at the tip of the wing come out there.

35:29.520 --> 35:33.520
I think, you know, Ragnar would say, well, how can you confuse them?

35:33.520 --> 35:42.520
But I think in the east, the two species are more dissimilar than other than other than they are.

35:42.520 --> 35:48.520
I'm saying that without ever having a collection in the east, so.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.520
Not right.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.520
Amarvia cune anemone.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.520
I made some mistakes earlier.

35:56.520 --> 36:02.520
There's a large eclairance that, because of its size and general appearance,

36:02.520 --> 36:05.520
I may have recorded this Amarvia.

36:05.520 --> 36:18.520
But I think Amarvia is later in the year, the adults are present later in the year than the Secranus speeches.

36:18.520 --> 36:28.520
But I would say spring records of Amarvia are probably suspect.

36:28.520 --> 36:38.520
And it's really a mistake I shouldn't have made, because the paltry are very different.

36:38.520 --> 36:43.520
One has truncated paltry, and then one has...

36:43.520 --> 36:48.520
Okay, I discussed the measure before.

36:48.520 --> 36:58.520
This is where I, you, you analyze it, because this is where I recorded the bulk of the specimens,

36:58.520 --> 37:03.520
all the ones that this specialist did.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.520
Okay.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.520
Well, I still don't think there was a piece of water.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.520
So I know some of you, the issue of selection asks...

37:09.520 --> 37:16.520
I'm going to kiss myself, and I think the rec packages, everything that I did not give have

37:16.520 --> 37:25.240
and we've got close to every

37:25.240 --> 37:29.520
threshold, I was saying all the vê碑, if I could make much more forヒ chop in,

37:29.520 --> 37:32.520
what is it we're just looking for?

37:32.520 --> 37:45.520
The column form has kind of a lot of white coloration on the leading edge of the four wings when outstretched.

37:45.520 --> 37:54.520
And in varying amounts. And the pattern is otherwise created using blacks and whites.

37:54.520 --> 38:04.520
Whereas the other one, the wing is about mostly down on the trailing edge with the wings outstretched.

38:04.520 --> 38:11.520
And then slight gray on the rest of the wing. So they look very different.

38:11.520 --> 38:17.520
And I've recorded them as two stations because I'm not sure.

38:17.520 --> 38:27.520
But I have been mixed before. And this gray and brown form, the one I call in four species in there,

38:27.520 --> 38:34.520
seems to be less abundant at Coltanian than it is in Davis.

38:34.520 --> 38:43.520
But I'm leaning now much more towards calling in the same species because this year when it was very common in Davis,

38:43.520 --> 38:52.520
I caught one or two specimens that were more intermediate than any between the two forms that I'd ever seen.

38:52.520 --> 39:00.520
And how in, you know, the Western Moth book stated there's very amounts of balance on it.

39:00.520 --> 39:11.520
Maybe he was referring to this other form with the slight gray, this predominantly straight slate gray.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.520
So what do I hold here?

39:15.520 --> 39:23.520
What I hold here...
