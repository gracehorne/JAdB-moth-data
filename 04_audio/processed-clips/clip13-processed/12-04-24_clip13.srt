1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, anyway, I trust you to make all the decisions as far as the modeling and so forth.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Awesome. Yeah, it's great to hear that.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll give you some feedback, but, you know, it's not really criticism.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's just something to consider.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In general, I want to give you feedback if it's something that pops out like that.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Correct me on these other situations with the name and quotation marks,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
it means that they used to have this terminology,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and certainly, in Latin, which means uncertain placement.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
These are ones where this is where they currently reside,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and those are probably wrong.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But the correct assignment is up for grads, or there's no correct assignment.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I think we're reading this one.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This one, Crepe on Nana, for the longest time, I couldn't put a name on it.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And Tim McCabe, who's with New York State Department of Agriculture, had a girlfriend who used to work in the lab that I did before.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But he'd come out here from time to time, and he collected at Cold Canyon once when he was out there.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And he sent me a list of the species that he caught.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And a lot of them, he used names that I wasn't using.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And one of them was Crepe in Nana.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And Ron Robertson, who was my natural specialist before him, thought it was a new species.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He was able to identify it on the basis of genitalia as a Crepe.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it was not a species that he knew, so he thought it was a new species.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And what is called Crepe in Nana, in our collection, in our collection, doesn't look very much like the specimens that I get called candy.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And this is a fairly common lot, even though there's a lot of zero in this here.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But it does look like pictures of what's called Danna on a line.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It does resemble pictures of Nana on a line.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And because Tim McCain, who doesn't communicate very much, gave me that name.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And that's what I decided to call him.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I'm pretty comfortable with that name now.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I know nothing about the line.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Crepe in Oklahoma.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Crepe in Oklahoma.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think it's one that they didn't have pictures on a lot of photographers.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is kind of a hard mock to identify.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I think the name is correct.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is what Ron Robertson thought it was, so I attributed it to him.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know, for any species that you choose to discuss individually, I, in general, recorded who gave me the identification.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And that's on a label in the unitary in the synoptic collection.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we can shift the blame for being somebody else who can think for that.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sounds good.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
какие25

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Exitelia, this was recently addressed.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Have you decided it doesn't fit the current definition of Exitelia.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know, historically there were various groups among that were divided, and further divided, and further divided.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's nobody worse than taxonomists for pigeonholing things, except maybe ecologists.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Ecologists need to find terms all the time.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
These are general terms.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And they say, well, I don't equate this.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think the new term is .

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And the same thing happens.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, you know, with butterflies, it's gotten ridiculous.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So that now there's almost as many general species.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The problem is you start obscuring the relationships.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know which general are related to the others.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think we need to bring back.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, there's not enough caterpillars.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's part of the problem.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, they get out of the .

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The grandosal is a very conspicuous moth.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So if I collected it as correct .

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, okay.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Very conspicuous.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know what would be helpful?

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And you've shown the document is using one or another checklist number.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because then you could just end in the checklist number and reference it back through the species.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because the names will change with the checklist number and something like it will change.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll just say recommendation in the future if there's something like this.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a very, I think it's, the pattern is very distinct.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Even though it's a small moth.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't use it.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There may be a similar species, but I don't think it's a .

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not correct with this one.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Olivia de Vesta.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Originally I had it under some other genus, the name of which escapes me at the moment.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And it's kind of a, I hate this here, cherries to use it all the time.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nondescript.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you describe something that's nondescript, that's kind of an oxymoron.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But this is a nondescript.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not one that pops out.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So it's one that's hard to sight ID identified by faces of the image.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because there's nothing obviously distinctive about it.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So until you've collected them over and over and over again, you don't recognize it.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But all of these nondescript forms are ones that have a greater probability of being

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
numerologically recorded.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I think that's an important point to me.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Orthodes, quote, no, Burka.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think it was in Polian report on the genus.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I don't have the concept of what that is on my head.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I'm surprised at the call point that I collected it often enough to be on here.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If I don't know what it is.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And it's one that I don't recollect collecting very much.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think what I should do is print out five copies of at least the five-month-old life.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, I don't know.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's kind of.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But that's what I was calling nondescript.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You know, if I was saying, well, what do you look for to identify that?

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I would have to say, properly identify .

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean, that's the value of the synaptic collection.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Because you don't have to look through everything.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Bill Patterson, you know, right?

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Before we had my photographic group, we'd come in here.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He'd go through drill after drill after drill after drill after drill.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then over and over again.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's a lot of work.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Absolutely.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that would make it hard for him to give up his collection.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But he's not doing too well.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So he has an enormous butterfly collection.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And that was the last part of his collection that easily changed.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We used to find that before figuring out.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Arizona.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Recently, I just redefined Arizona.

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But it's always been in Arizona, but not .

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And this is a somewhat distinctive chain lecture.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't know too much about, I don't know very much about the life history.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But in general, I turned it not to look up the life histories of macros.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was one of the other students of macros.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Avigrotus.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Avigrotus.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We have one, two, three that you included.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But there's some other species that you didn't include.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Avigrotus.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No, you included just two of them.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I thought I had a box full of Avigrotus unidentified.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And I couldn't find it.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, I was rummaging around and I found it.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And it turned out that there's only four remaining that I couldn't identify.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
After I had done some dissection.

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So there's four that I would likely dissect.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But that probably won't change things very much for you.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I thought that there were some other species that were common enough to be included using the criteria that I'm not sure.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Malauri is very similar to a larger species with a more southerly distribution according to the monograph that includes the genus.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:50,000
However, a lot of Southern California laws do extend a lot farther to the north than anybody thought in the valley and in the foothills.

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But there hasn't been a lot of collectors who have stuff.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And collectors go to places that are cool.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The flashy places.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I did have a couple of larger specimens of what looks like balauri.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And the genitalia of balauri.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And the southern species, the name of which escapes me right now.

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I retain here that it's deceptive and looks like balauri.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It could be that balauri is a mixture of the species.

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And it could be that there's a species.

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:57,000
La Fontaine, who could the fascicle on the non-cturus, at least this group of non-cturus, the non-cturus, is a splitter.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So if they can find a reason to call one species, too, it's going to be two.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Chagonia is a smaller species of amigrotus.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I think the females are dark brown and the males are light brown or the other way around.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't remember.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But it's unusual in that in most of the nocturus, in this genus of related genera,

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the tip of the female abdomen is kind of flattened.

161
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And the male abdomen is rounded all the way to the apex.

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, this one, the female, is also rounded to the apex.

163
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So you have to look a little closer to tell whether it's a male or female.

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And there's another small species called canyon, which, if you looked at the distribution map,

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and the monofascicles shouldn't be there.

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I just have to remember what it looks like, but it shouldn't be.

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, the distribution map's there.

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're only at the specimens of the museum.

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And after I, eventually I got both sepsis of it and it's a good match.

170
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But amigrotus is a difficult change because a lot of the, there's a few distinct species,

171
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
but there's a lot of them that are similar to one or several other species.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So there are pairs or groups of species that are very similar to one another.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And when you're deceptive and you know what's in your memory and intention,

174
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you're supposed to be in the one another again.

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But every once in a while there's a possibility that something's real about it.

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Unless you're alert for it, you listen.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And Surin and Arnalis is a very distinctive species.

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I love to, flies, late winter, early spring.

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So every specimen that I collected has been recorded.

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The Chira Occidentalis, you know, we discussed the Chira before.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ran Talvis is the one that's more widely distributed.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think it's the one that's more widely distributed.

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think Occidentalis has a common name, but it may be the other one, I'm not sure.

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I've not caught the ones that are called Ran Talis at Cope Canyon, or very seldom have caught them there,

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
whereas Ran Talis seems to be the dominant species in Davis.

186
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And I've done a few dissections, but not a lot.

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know, I'd have to look to see whether I recorded NES or E or O.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But I don't think it would be proper if you're going to analyze them to combine the two together and insert the new model,

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because I think they have very different types of books, ranges, and biologians, and so forth.

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And that's the Dender, where they're combined spaces,

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and through obscuring the patterns of each component of the combination.

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Clarice Foley and the Tarchessa that feeds on the Mountain Mahogany.

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And this is always a scientific name, because...

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have to do like a Heimlich maneuver to my brain to spurn out.

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Arcane.

196
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's the Mountain Mahogany, you know, Shepard Hill.

197
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So it kind of comes, it goes, this is what it'll probably be.

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You know, it might be better after fire, because...

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's not a lot of circle carcass like cocaine, and most of it is on the west faces, sort of,

200
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and not on the bottom floor, or on the east.

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So not in the places where I put them off that surround.

202
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And the...

203
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can look at it a lot of them.

204
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The Acrobasis Collisionella is quite difficult to tell apart by faces from Acrobasis...

205
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh.

206
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
...concilla.

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Concilla.

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Got it.

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

210
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They'll stay on oaks.

211
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Males are easy to tell apart because they have an antenna character.

212
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Right.

213
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Let's say they're present or absent.

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But it's always absent on the females, so they're a little bit harder apart.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But once you separate them, you know, and you have a series of them, you can map them.

216
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're no longer new to.

217
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But I mention that because there's quite a high probability that I have misidentified collisionella,

218
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
or confused collisionella with Comptella.

219
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So the numbers of both could be wrong.

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Mm-hmm.

221
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But they're both suspicious.

222
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They behave fairly near once.

223
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If you want to turn sorry about Bill Patterson's before the...

224
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
...if you do, you do, you do, you do.

225
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He said, oh, you know, now they look different.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They're separate.

227
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You know.

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He looked at them.

229
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's really good.

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I couldn't tell.

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The stuff couldn't tell the difference.

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But I can see it.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You know.

234
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes.

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But it's hard sometimes to put into words.

236
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What it is.

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The things that we can see initially.

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

239
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Like I could solve it on them.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Pecker makes a struggle now on the other hand.

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Who knows?

242
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Very different from the other two.

243
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And as I mentioned, at Colcannon, it seems to be on Toyah more than anything.

244
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And if I recall correctly, and it's always a danger, it plasters together a couple of leaves

245
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and it's found in kind of a silken shelter.

246
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So it doesn't roll the leaves anymore.

247
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It just kind of plasters two together.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it sees their numbers on to other leaves.

249
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And they're, you get it throughout the year.

250
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So there's probably more than that.

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The other generation.

252
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Of course, the ones on oak.

253
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So they're just a central generation.

254
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Probably because of the tannins of oak.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Makes it unpalatable.

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Much of the year.

257
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This acrolophic green genus movie.

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Acrolophidae has been treated as a family from time to time, but also as a son family.

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And that's how it's treated in New Checkers.

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So it's an acrolofine in a way.

261
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I sent this to a specialist who is, they wanted to have a monophacical, but it probably won't be published.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Because all the models are kind of mousy-bound looking and look very much like one another.

263
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the exception between this and the other species, which are currently in the genus imagery, and there's two at Cold Canyon, is obvious.

264
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This one, you look at the palpi, and the palpi are very different than the two that are in the genus imagery.

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But the specialists who are doing the monochemists have decided that the two that are currently in the genus are in two different genera.

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But I don't know that those two genera are differentiated on the basis of external characters or not.

267
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:36,000
With that said, all of the new genus, new species, are probably recorded and recorded as new genus, new species.

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Whereas all of the amygia-like ones are recorded as one or the other.

269
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And the ones that were recorded as one or the other were the ones that the specialists examined.

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And all the others, I'm not going to disser.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He had a way of just teasing on them.

272
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He could see things externally that would tell him whether they were one or the other.

273
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
After he teased on some of the hairline scales on the tip of the abdomen of both men and men,

274
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and he tried to describe it to me that, you know, without saying it under high magnification,

275
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
he didn't have the ability to do it.

276
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I couldn't have sold that.

277
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And so I've just been recorded in this year or...

278
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But he told me that there's probably another species here that was not among the dozens of specialists that I have done with them.

279
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He's one of those rare cases where you send something else to a specialist

280
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and the turnaround time is weeks rather than years.

281
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, wow.

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He came back and everyone has a lot of family.

283
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Probably because he's an amateur or other professional.

284
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Acrolophus, careful.

285
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Acrolophus is another acrolophus.

286
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Acrolophus, fine.

287
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And the tropics, these are...

288
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
A lot of the species have labial palates that come up and curve back well beyond the back of the head.

289
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wow.

290
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But the ones we have out here are shorter though.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They don't have those enormous recurred labial palates.

292
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Tear file items are larger species than it is the other one, Latta Capitania.

293
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I got it for the first time in my backyard this year.

294
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
No records before.

295
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I've never caught Latta Capitania in my backyard.

296
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And Latta Capitania is the very colony that called Penny.

297
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Do you remember that night that we went out and I forgot to remind you and Emily that we were going to go collect?

298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That night was so windy.

299
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We only got it out for a moment.

300
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, in my life.

301
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No.

302
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But I think almost all the moss that we collected that night were acrolophus by the Capitania.

303
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And these species, I don't know too much about the biology, but the acrolophus that are in the nutria, I think, are associated with rotent burrows.

304
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That sort of situation.

305
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And these may get an animal habitat as well.

306
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You know, they're related to canelias and a lot of the canelias are female characters and hairs and horny materials and so forth.

307
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So, you know, a good classification is allowing you to make certain predictions about the biology.

308
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't know.

309
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You know, I don't know.

310
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's easy, but it breaks down in some degrees.

311
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's a specimen maybe.

312
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You can't do it.

313
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah.

314
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And the fichita was my two or two.

315
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Acronecta.

316
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know which one.

317
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I originally recorded Acronecta infleda.

318
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:32,000
to it. It has two species, Impita and Impressa. So in some of the old spreadsheets, you see

319
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
both names. And there recently was a Mona, a classical donor. But Jeff, somebody had

320
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
borrowed all the material before and that person never worked on it. And eventually

321
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the person who wrote the classical corral of all of those numbers. And there was nothing

322
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to compare specimens with, because everybody had known their specimens to this person.

323
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So that was like plotting them.

324
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her.

325
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So based on some photographs that I have, I thought they were just

326
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
variations of white species. And it turns out that Impita is much larger than Impressa

327
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
on that basis alone. But we had accumulated material here in the

328
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
that were not seen by the person who did the monograph. And Jeff sent him photographs

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and he was able to identify strictly on the basis of photographs. And now that we have

330
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,000
a good reference, I think everything is correct. And I made errors. And I think most of these are

331
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
somewhat generous on trees and shrubs.

332
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You know, that's why he's not raised. He's full of information. He gets a little cranky about

333
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
sharing it with other people from time to time. If he knows that you're going to use it

334
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
rather than you're just curious.

335
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I talked to him just recently. He's making noise about retiring once it gets.

336
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, interesting.

337
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Acronecta marmorata is the most common one. And we get it here in Davis. The other two species I've not seen in Davis.

338
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:55,000
In Marmorata, I think it's fairly widespread. And I think it probably in Davis is an oak moth. And it may be an oak moth in general.

339
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Acronecta prodita is a very dark species with a white hindrance. So it's fairly easy to recognize.

340
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And it's fairly easy to recognize.

341
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The delphagrotus indeterminata we discussed in Davis. But again, early specimens might have been confused with what I was

342
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
calling .

343
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Until that fascicle came out.

344
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There's another species of the delphagrotus indeterminata in Southern California that I keep looking for because

345
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,760
in Southern California that I keep looking for,

346
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,760
because they look the same, except that the deltagrotus

347
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,760
endoterminata has a black prothoracic collar

348
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,240
that looks like the deltagrotus falminus.

349
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,520
Whereas the other one, I think it's called stovirus,

350
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,640
has a pale prothoracic collar.

351
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,560
And there's no reason why that species shouldn't be here,

352
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,320
but I haven't found it, I've never found it.

353
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,560
And I can not direct post-discollar.

354
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:24,560
This is in the depressority, which used to be a part of it.

355
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,320
Maybe it makes you sad.

356
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,320
They're hard to identify, don't they still think?

357
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:38,320
It used to be combined with the other decoformers.

358
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,320
There was some family that today, family, decoformers,

359
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
decoformers, as it appeared in the previous checklists,

360
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,320
is now at least two families, and I think three.

361
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Three, and maybe four.

362
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,320
So stovat, stovat, stovat, with the other one.

363
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
And we don't have that deal.

364
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
So this is the decoformer.

365
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,320
And caterpillars are somewhat easy to find,

366
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,320
because they make shelters, and the shelters are big enough

367
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
that you can find them.

368
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Toaster salad feeds on chaperone feed.

369
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
And we don't have to.

370
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
And they call it, um.

371
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
And they call it, um.

372
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
And they call it, um.

373
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
And they call it, um.

374
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
And they call it, um.

375
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
And they're just gonna charge anyway.

376
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
And they used to be, I don't know,

377
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,320
it's always showing me crazy how.

378
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,320
What's reaching this now?

379
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I don't know, like, how a creeper is in India.

380
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Yeah.

381
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Yeah.

382
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Yeah.

383
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Yeah.

384
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Yeah.

385
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Yeah.

386
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Yeah, I guess so.

387
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
But it was in something that started with,

388
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I don't know.

389
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Anyway, it was split off.

390
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,320
And one of the species, soralea,

391
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
is what it used to be, P-S-O-R-A.

392
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
So there's a species of agonoptera.

393
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
It's called soralea.

394
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,320
And, um, it's not included here.

395
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
But that also feeds on this plant.

396
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,320
And when I heard, um, um, soralea.

397
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Soralea really explodes after fire.

398
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
So you would expect it to be more common after fire.

399
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
But this species, um,

400
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Rosacella, seems to be fairly common,

401
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,320
regardless of whether it's a year or two after fire or not.

402
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,320
It was far more common than soralea.

403
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
But when I collected categories,

404
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,320
I don't think that I was a career with species.

405
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,320
But I did with soralea, which is selenken.

406
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
And all the species,

407
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,320
I believe all the species overwintered as adults.

408
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
So there's a,

409
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
that's why you get them throughout the years.

410
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
It's not because of multiple generations.

411
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,320
And like I said, they're flattened.

412
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,320
And that flattening enables them to hide in crevices and so forth.

413
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
So there's a reason why they flattened.

414
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
And that flattening is very common with overwintering species.

415
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Oh, no.

416
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Oh, okay.

417
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah.

418
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,320
So most of the deepest soralea are flattened that way.

419
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Okay, which line was because ofpełic.

420
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Yes.

421
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Yes.

422
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
You know,

423
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
youankenixen for Megal Shepherd.

424
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Okay, what else did you say,

425
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
let me just ask.

426
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
I didn't ask her if my question is,

427
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
how do you actually Henrietta

428
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
issue make sure you had that huge data,

429
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
what would you make sure you put this really bad pode?

430
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
In fact,

431
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,320
I didn't want to risk use all of these species a little bit

432
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
here right now.

433
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
And then that's like you otra interface

434
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
and I got to different些 species here.

435
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
And

436
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,620
Davis, where I was really, I used to be excited to get one system, but I think particularly

437
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:11,520
last year, I don't have that. I got more last year than all other years combined. I just

438
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:25,520
have this notion that in general, it goes through the long periods, long cycles of, you know, periodic,

439
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:37,520
and people who work on it, people who always like to attribute it to natural enemies.

440
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:49,520
But it could be disease, it could be herb creation, spider creation, and the same way.

441
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:58,520
It was fairly common at the Coal Canyon once I started collecting in those months.

442
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:10,520
And it has a very consistent pattern, but the brown color is not so consistent.

443
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:20,520
There are various earth patterns, from yellowish brown, to reddish brown, to chocolate brown,

444
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:28,520
and various shades of brown. You know, how all cars now seem to be different shades of gray.

445
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I hate it. I'm looking like a navy here.

446
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:46,520
I brought this ipsilon that I talked about in Davis. It has some little black dash marks near the wing tips

447
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,520
and it seems to be, you know, they seem to be present, you know, the person who, the one that says,

448
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,520
they seem to be present even on the warm specimens.

449
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Some of them look a little bit like some examples of feltria, subterranea, and also peridermal salsia.

450
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,520
And also it has that kind of bluish shade to the high end.

451
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
And feltria always has a white pioneer, so it is.

452
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
And then the dashes at the tip of the wing come out there.

453
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I think, you know, Ragnar would say, well, how can you confuse them?

454
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:42,520
But I think in the east, the two species are more dissimilar than other than other than they are.

455
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,520
I'm saying that without ever having a collection in the east, so.

456
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Not right.

457
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Amarvia cune anemone.

458
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,520
I made some mistakes earlier.

459
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,520
There's a large eclairance that, because of its size and general appearance,

460
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I may have recorded this Amarvia.

461
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:18,520
But I think Amarvia is later in the year, the adults are present later in the year than the Secranus speeches.

462
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:28,520
But I would say spring records of Amarvia are probably suspect.

463
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:38,520
And it's really a mistake I shouldn't have made, because the paltry are very different.

464
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,520
One has truncated paltry, and then one has...

465
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Okay, I discussed the measure before.

466
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:58,520
This is where I, you, you analyze it, because this is where I recorded the bulk of the specimens,

467
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,520
all the ones that this specialist did.

468
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Okay.

469
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Well, I still don't think there was a piece of water.

470
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
So I know some of you, the issue of selection asks...

471
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,520
I'm going to kiss myself, and I think the rec packages, everything that I did not give have

472
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:25,240
and we've got close to every

473
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,520
threshold, I was saying all the vê碑, if I could make much more forヒ chop in,

474
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,520
what is it we're just looking for?

475
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:45,520
The column form has kind of a lot of white coloration on the leading edge of the four wings when outstretched.

476
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:54,520
And in varying amounts. And the pattern is otherwise created using blacks and whites.

477
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Whereas the other one, the wing is about mostly down on the trailing edge with the wings outstretched.

478
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:11,520
And then slight gray on the rest of the wing. So they look very different.

479
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,520
And I've recorded them as two stations because I'm not sure.

480
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:27,520
But I have been mixed before. And this gray and brown form, the one I call in four species in there,

481
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,520
seems to be less abundant at Coltanian than it is in Davis.

482
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:43,520
But I'm leaning now much more towards calling in the same species because this year when it was very common in Davis,

483
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:52,520
I caught one or two specimens that were more intermediate than any between the two forms that I'd ever seen.

484
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:00,520
And how in, you know, the Western Moth book stated there's very amounts of balance on it.

485
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Maybe he was referring to this other form with the slight gray, this predominantly straight slate gray.

486
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,520
So what do I hold here?

487
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,520
What I hold here...
