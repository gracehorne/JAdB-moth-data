1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Okay, you can express now.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:23,460
The decline at Cold Canyon could be attributable to the fact that I collected mainly in the valley floor in the early years and then moved up into the higher trail on the west wall of the canyon and further away from the willows.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,880
But we have that in the model too.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,420
Yeah.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,080
And so if that was the case, if that was driving it, we wouldn't see the decline.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
Well, perhaps. I don't know.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,380
Well, if you trust our model.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,220
Yeah.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,440
Well, you know, everything in science is if the model is right, then this is the conclusion.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,500
But people seldom examine the if portion of them.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,080
Yeah. Models are always wrong.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
They present it and then move on.

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,040
Well, we're going to try to convince you to trust our model.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,380
Well, I'll leave it to people who read the paper.

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,020
Okay.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,020
It's agreeable to not because I'm not an expert on the model and other people are.

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,780
Galgula apartheid is a widespread moth and it flies during the day as well as in the evening.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't know that I ever got it at Cold Canyon.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,320
No.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,380
I don't see it.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
And it has a long flight period.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,900
And during the day, I see females more often than I see males.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,820
And it's one of those that has a fancy caterpillar.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,300
So every once in a while, somebody will send a picture of the caterpillar into the museum for identification.

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:02,140
And as you can see, it's kind of all over the place for records in my backyard.

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,800
And I guess you couldn't identify any trends there.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,580
I think, you know, Wagner wrote a caterpillar book.

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,140
And in it, he has information on hosts.

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,740
And he's currently writing one on Western species.

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,440
So there'll be more information on Noctuas down the line.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,860
But Galeria melanela is the greater wax moth.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,640
So this is the one that comes out of beehives, honeybee hives.

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,360
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,980
Can you tell me more about that?

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:53,620
And it's probably non-native and was introduced along with apiculture in this country.

36
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:02,620
But where it's native to, you know, it's kind of cosmopolitan now because apiculture is all over the world.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,540
Do you know why it might show an increase in Davis and a decline in Cold Canyon?

38
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:26,760
Well, it could be due to the fact that, you know, we've had honeybee decline throughout the country.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:37,520
And one time I took a hike and I encountered a honeybee hive, a ground-nesting honeybee hive during the hike.

40
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,900
So I know there's some wild colonies of honeybees at Cold Canyon.

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:52,720
And being a ground-nesting one, that's one, and it was in an area that has burned more frequently than just the major fires.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:09,900
So it and maybe some of the other colonies or hives have been destroyed by fire or by ants and other pests that get into beehives.

43
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:21,280
You know, a lot of the things that I collected, you know, non-moths that I collected because they were kind of cool things in the early years at Cold Canyon,

44
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,860
like velvet ants disappeared over the years.

45
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,440
There used to be a real fancy red one, and I haven't seen it for many, many years.

46
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,660
So things change.

47
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,240
I didn't even know we had velvet ants.

48
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,400
I did because there's this kid in my ant one class who I assigned him a spider,

49
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,340
and he made a very long argument for why I should have assigned him a velvet ant,

50
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,260
and I let him keep the velvet ant because he was so annoying and right.

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,580
But, you know, just when you think something disappears, you get another one.

52
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,080
That's what Art says, too.

53
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,420
He says the same thing.

54
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,920
Helico-verpizia is the corn earworm.

55
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,540
Where is that one on here?

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,580
Helico-verpizia.

57
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,200
I don't have it.

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,760
You may have some before.

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah, it may not.

60
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,680
I may have no records for Cold Canyon.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:28,260
I think I got more this year than I haven't ever before, but, you know,

62
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,780
it may depend on how closely they're growing corn and whether they're growing BT corn.

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah.

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,140
But it's not specific to corn.

65
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,220
I think it feeds on other plants as well.

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,360
Heliosus phloxophaga.

67
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,760
This is an interesting moth because after one of the fires, I think the first, the fire of 96,

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,440
there was a lot of prickly lettuce grew up in Cold Canyon.

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:10,740
And when I set up the light at dusk, there were lots and lots of these coming to the flowers for nectar.

70
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,760
But I got none at blacklight.

71
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,220
So I think this is a species that's not highly drawn to blacklight or to light.

72
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:34,440
So, you know, that's why I've kind of emphasized that collecting by light gives you different results

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,040
than collecting using other strategies.

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Absolutely.

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Absolutely.

76
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,500
Hemi-Ezoa-Ruden's.

77
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,260
Oh, is this for a bunch of times?

78
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,660
Yeah.

79
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,140
Nice.

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,360
That's perfect.

81
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,440
Oh, that's great.

82
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,160
It's kind of interesting.

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,060
I thought I had it in pretty good numbers all along, but it shows that it's been increasing in Davis.

84
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,460
I don't know that this was a very good year for it, but I'd have to check.

85
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:16,920
And I'd have to look up the host plant, but I found it out by checking on the Internet so you could do the same.

86
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you think it's native?

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:29,480
Well, it's widespread, only in the west, so I suspect it's a native species and west of the Great Basin primarily.

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,220
What about this one?

89
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,880
Flexifega is widespread.

90
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,900
It has a common name, like, I can't remember.

91
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,640
It's so hard to tell.

92
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,960
I can't remember scientific and common names most, but.

93
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,440
Yeah.

94
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,300
Bug Guide says it eats snakeweed.

95
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah, and, you know, ESA has that common names manual, you know, the ESA-approved common names.

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,500
And it seems like nobody goes back to these approved names.

97
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,240
It's just like they've abandoned the ICZN for nomenclature rules, and it's crazy.

98
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,180
The Internet has made everybody stupid.

99
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,220
Quote me.

100
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,220
I will quote it.

101
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Henricus umbra basanus is specific to oaks.

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:44,180
And it's in a small subfamily of tartricids that are allegedly being revised, but this is one species whose name will probably not be changed.

103
00:08:44,180 --> 00:09:00,640
And because I have no oaks in my yard, it shows up intermittently, whereas Greg, who does have oaks in his neighborhood, more oaks in his neighborhood, reports it more frequently than I.

104
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:10,960
So, you know, the oaks were recently devastated at Cold Canyon, so it may be a victim of fires at Cold Canyon.

105
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,700
Yeah, it looks like it's holding on.

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,360
Yeah, but I didn't go there after the most recent fire, which wiped out the remaining oaks, many of the remaining oaks.

107
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,260
Yeah, it did.

108
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:41,980
I hope that by posting the Cold Canyon data, people in the future, especially since the UC Reserve, will compare then with during my tenure there.

109
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,080
People.

110
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:42,940
Yeah.

111
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,980
You said you hope people.

112
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,360
Well, I'm not looking at, in a year or two, I'm looking at, you know, somebody.

113
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,060
Well, hopefully we'll live for a while.

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:02,780
One of the first projects that I worked on was Jerry, there was a Life magazine, which you may have never heard of, I don't know, some years ago,

115
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:17,140
that looked at the dunes in Antioch, where there was an endangered butterfly and some endangered, there was some endangered species because it was kind of a unique habitat.

116
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,760
And it was a place where a lot of collectors, especially from Berkeley, and Davis was part of Berkeley.

117
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,340
Is this one that you sent me, uh, the blue butterfly on the coast?

118
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,480
Yeah, is it a blue?

119
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,860
This is a metal mark.

120
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,680
Oh, never heard of a metal mark.

121
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,060
Oh, okay.

122
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,220
Um, but they all went there.

123
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,800
It had legless lizards, um, you know, which my brother was interested in snakes and lizards, so we went there and clicked.

124
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,740
Well, the dunes are mined, and the butterfly seems to be extinct.

125
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
Um, what was I talking about?

126
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,280
Which species?

127
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
Uh, no.

128
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,360
This one.

129
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Well, you were talking about this one.

130
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,880
I was talking about it.

131
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,020
Yeah.

132
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,780
They're in here.

133
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,460
Oh, okay.

134
00:10:59,580 --> 00:10:59,740
Yeah.

135
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:11,700
Oh, the first project that I worked on, Jerry went to all the museums and got old records for a number of families,

136
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,400
many of which were Lepidopter, but also things like robber flies and bees, I think.

137
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:30,540
And, you know, that was my first trip to Davis Museum, was gathering records from the museum, such as it was back then.

138
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:41,220
Um, and he was then going to the dune years after this Life magazine to see what was still there and what had disappeared.

139
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,080
So, that's my thinking.

140
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:55,380
Maybe in future years, people will go to Cold Canyon, or even just collect in Davis, and wonder, you know, what's new and what's disappeared.

141
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:06,220
You know, Art, in his emails, pointed out that there was a big Saturnian moth that used to be along Puta Creek, and it disappeared during our lifetimes.

142
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,300
You know, it hasn't been seen in years, so whether it's completely gone or not remains to be seen.

143
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,220
And that particular species was also at Antioch Dunes and disappeared from there.

144
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,100
What's the name of it?

145
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:33,700
Um, Hamiluca, or Aglantarita, E-G-L-A-N-T-E-R-I-N-A.

146
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Oh, wow.

147
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,000
That one.

148
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,680
Oh.

149
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,360
It's a day flying moth.

150
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,480
Isn't that one up in the mountains still?

151
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,260
Yes.

152
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
It's widespread.

153
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,480
It has a cute little caterpillar, too, that tends to go along trails.

154
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,020
Yeah, you see it wandering off.

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:13:00,080
And it's difficult to rear because if it gets the least bit disturbed after it pupates, it doesn't seem to survive.

156
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,120
And then they get highly parasitized because they wander off to pupate.

157
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:15,140
The last instar seems to be a generalist, whereas the early instars feed, don't move off whatever the eggs were laid on.

158
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,560
I've never heard of that before.

159
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,440
I mean, that makes sense if you're going to disperse.

160
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,580
Yeah.

161
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,700
So I found it at San Bruno Mountain, which is the first place that I surveyed.

162
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,860
I have to leave in four minutes, so I think...

163
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,500
And then...

164
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,440
...
