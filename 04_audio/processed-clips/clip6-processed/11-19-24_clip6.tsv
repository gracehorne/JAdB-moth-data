0	3220	Okay, you can express now.
3220	23460	The decline at Cold Canyon could be attributable to the fact that I collected mainly in the valley floor in the early years and then moved up into the higher trail on the west wall of the canyon and further away from the willows.
24440	25880	But we have that in the model too.
27080	27420	Yeah.
30000	37080	And so if that was the case, if that was driving it, we wouldn't see the decline.
37840	39120	Well, perhaps. I don't know.
39440	42380	Well, if you trust our model.
43040	43220	Yeah.
46620	53440	Well, you know, everything in science is if the model is right, then this is the conclusion.
53440	58500	But people seldom examine the if portion of them.
58500	60080	Yeah. Models are always wrong.
61400	63400	They present it and then move on.
64540	69040	Well, we're going to try to convince you to trust our model.
69040	73380	Well, I'll leave it to people who read the paper.
74580	75020	Okay.
75680	80020	It's agreeable to not because I'm not an expert on the model and other people are.
82220	88780	Galgula apartheid is a widespread moth and it flies during the day as well as in the evening.
88780	91080	I don't know that I ever got it at Cold Canyon.
92080	92320	No.
92520	93380	I don't see it.
93420	95100	And it has a long flight period.
97520	101900	And during the day, I see females more often than I see males.
101900	104820	And it's one of those that has a fancy caterpillar.
105000	111300	So every once in a while, somebody will send a picture of the caterpillar into the museum for identification.
113380	122140	And as you can see, it's kind of all over the place for records in my backyard.
122140	125800	And I guess you couldn't identify any trends there.
132200	135580	I think, you know, Wagner wrote a caterpillar book.
135720	141140	And in it, he has information on hosts.
141920	145740	And he's currently writing one on Western species.
146220	149440	So there'll be more information on Noctuas down the line.
149440	153860	But Galeria melanela is the greater wax moth.
154460	158640	So this is the one that comes out of beehives, honeybee hives.
158820	159360	Oh, my God.
159360	160980	Can you tell me more about that?
162180	173620	And it's probably non-native and was introduced along with apiculture in this country.
173620	182620	But where it's native to, you know, it's kind of cosmopolitan now because apiculture is all over the world.
185840	191540	Do you know why it might show an increase in Davis and a decline in Cold Canyon?
191540	206760	Well, it could be due to the fact that, you know, we've had honeybee decline throughout the country.
206760	217520	And one time I took a hike and I encountered a honeybee hive, a ground-nesting honeybee hive during the hike.
217720	221900	So I know there's some wild colonies of honeybees at Cold Canyon.
221900	232720	And being a ground-nesting one, that's one, and it was in an area that has burned more frequently than just the major fires.
233080	249900	So it and maybe some of the other colonies or hives have been destroyed by fire or by ants and other pests that get into beehives.
249900	261280	You know, a lot of the things that I collected, you know, non-moths that I collected because they were kind of cool things in the early years at Cold Canyon,
261900	267860	like velvet ants disappeared over the years.
267960	272440	There used to be a real fancy red one, and I haven't seen it for many, many years.
272760	274660	So things change.
274660	278240	I didn't even know we had velvet ants.
279380	284400	I did because there's this kid in my ant one class who I assigned him a spider,
284660	288340	and he made a very long argument for why I should have assigned him a velvet ant,
288460	291260	and I let him keep the velvet ant because he was so annoying and right.
294360	297580	But, you know, just when you think something disappears, you get another one.
297580	299080	That's what Art says, too.
299240	300420	He says the same thing.
301180	305920	Helico-verpizia is the corn earworm.
308140	309540	Where is that one on here?
311000	311580	Helico-verpizia.
312380	313200	I don't have it.
313200	313760	You may have some before.
313860	314560	Yeah, it may not.
315240	317680	I may have no records for Cold Canyon.
317680	328260	I think I got more this year than I haven't ever before, but, you know,
328340	333780	it may depend on how closely they're growing corn and whether they're growing BT corn.
334160	334400	Yeah.
335680	339140	But it's not specific to corn.
339260	342220	I think it feeds on other plants as well.
345220	346360	Heliosus phloxophaga.
346360	352760	This is an interesting moth because after one of the fires, I think the first, the fire of 96,
353620	360440	there was a lot of prickly lettuce grew up in Cold Canyon.
361480	370740	And when I set up the light at dusk, there were lots and lots of these coming to the flowers for nectar.
371540	373760	But I got none at blacklight.
373760	384220	So I think this is a species that's not highly drawn to blacklight or to light.
385220	394440	So, you know, that's why I've kind of emphasized that collecting by light gives you different results
394440	398040	than collecting using other strategies.
398360	398800	Absolutely.
398800	399000	Absolutely.
405540	407500	Hemi-Ezoa-Ruden's.
408180	409260	Oh, is this for a bunch of times?
409440	409660	Yeah.
410660	411140	Nice.
411680	412360	That's perfect.
412780	413440	Oh, that's great.
414220	415160	It's kind of interesting.
415160	421060	I thought I had it in pretty good numbers all along, but it shows that it's been increasing in Davis.
422380	426460	I don't know that this was a very good year for it, but I'd have to check.
426460	436920	And I'd have to look up the host plant, but I found it out by checking on the Internet so you could do the same.
436920	437720	Do you think it's native?
439720	449480	Well, it's widespread, only in the west, so I suspect it's a native species and west of the Great Basin primarily.
449480	450220	What about this one?
451640	453880	Flexifega is widespread.
454200	458900	It has a common name, like, I can't remember.
458900	459640	It's so hard to tell.
459640	462960	I can't remember scientific and common names most, but.
463280	463440	Yeah.
464380	466300	Bug Guide says it eats snakeweed.
467500	476400	Yeah, and, you know, ESA has that common names manual, you know, the ESA-approved common names.
477060	481500	And it seems like nobody goes back to these approved names.
481500	488240	It's just like they've abandoned the ICZN for nomenclature rules, and it's crazy.
488240	490180	The Internet has made everybody stupid.
491440	492220	Quote me.
494320	495220	I will quote it.
498440	504160	Henricus umbra basanus is specific to oaks.
504160	524180	And it's in a small subfamily of tartricids that are allegedly being revised, but this is one species whose name will probably not be changed.
524180	540640	And because I have no oaks in my yard, it shows up intermittently, whereas Greg, who does have oaks in his neighborhood, more oaks in his neighborhood, reports it more frequently than I.
541760	550960	So, you know, the oaks were recently devastated at Cold Canyon, so it may be a victim of fires at Cold Canyon.
550960	553700	Yeah, it looks like it's holding on.
556120	563360	Yeah, but I didn't go there after the most recent fire, which wiped out the remaining oaks, many of the remaining oaks.
563640	564260	Yeah, it did.
564260	581980	I hope that by posting the Cold Canyon data, people in the future, especially since the UC Reserve, will compare then with during my tenure there.
581980	582080	People.
582740	582940	Yeah.
584420	585980	You said you hope people.
585980	591360	Well, I'm not looking at, in a year or two, I'm looking at, you know, somebody.
591580	593060	Well, hopefully we'll live for a while.
593880	602780	One of the first projects that I worked on was Jerry, there was a Life magazine, which you may have never heard of, I don't know, some years ago,
602780	617140	that looked at the dunes in Antioch, where there was an endangered butterfly and some endangered, there was some endangered species because it was kind of a unique habitat.
617520	623760	And it was a place where a lot of collectors, especially from Berkeley, and Davis was part of Berkeley.
623760	627340	Is this one that you sent me, uh, the blue butterfly on the coast?
627360	628480	Yeah, is it a blue?
628720	629860	This is a metal mark.
630040	630680	Oh, never heard of a metal mark.
630680	631060	Oh, okay.
632100	634220	Um, but they all went there.
634320	640800	It had legless lizards, um, you know, which my brother was interested in snakes and lizards, so we went there and clicked.
641180	644740	Well, the dunes are mined, and the butterfly seems to be extinct.
646560	648640	Um, what was I talking about?
648700	649280	Which species?
650480	651840	Uh, no.
653760	654360	This one.
656300	657600	Well, you were talking about this one.
657600	657880	I was talking about it.
657900	658020	Yeah.
658300	658780	They're in here.
659060	659460	Oh, okay.
659580	659740	Yeah.
661340	671700	Oh, the first project that I worked on, Jerry went to all the museums and got old records for a number of families,
672240	680400	many of which were Lepidopter, but also things like robber flies and bees, I think.
680400	690540	And, you know, that was my first trip to Davis Museum, was gathering records from the museum, such as it was back then.
690540	701220	Um, and he was then going to the dune years after this Life magazine to see what was still there and what had disappeared.
701220	705080	So, that's my thinking.
705080	715380	Maybe in future years, people will go to Cold Canyon, or even just collect in Davis, and wonder, you know, what's new and what's disappeared.
715380	726220	You know, Art, in his emails, pointed out that there was a big Saturnian moth that used to be along Puta Creek, and it disappeared during our lifetimes.
726420	733300	You know, it hasn't been seen in years, so whether it's completely gone or not remains to be seen.
733420	737220	And that particular species was also at Antioch Dunes and disappeared from there.
737280	738100	What's the name of it?
738100	753700	Um, Hamiluca, or Aglantarita, E-G-L-A-N-T-E-R-I-N-A.
753700	754300	Oh, wow.
754540	755000	That one.
755340	755680	Oh.
756240	757360	It's a day flying moth.
757500	760480	Isn't that one up in the mountains still?
760940	761260	Yes.
761720	762560	It's widespread.
763820	767480	It has a cute little caterpillar, too, that tends to go along trails.
767480	770020	Yeah, you see it wandering off.
771640	780080	And it's difficult to rear because if it gets the least bit disturbed after it pupates, it doesn't seem to survive.
782160	786120	And then they get highly parasitized because they wander off to pupate.
786460	795140	The last instar seems to be a generalist, whereas the early instars feed, don't move off whatever the eggs were laid on.
796020	797560	I've never heard of that before.
798220	800440	I mean, that makes sense if you're going to disperse.
801320	801580	Yeah.
802540	808700	So I found it at San Bruno Mountain, which is the first place that I surveyed.
808700	812860	I have to leave in four minutes, so I think...
812860	813500	And then...
813500	814440	...
