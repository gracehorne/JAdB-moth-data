00:00.000 --> 00:04.660
Good going for a little bit, and I'll record number three, and I will go check Ani Lozeth.

00:05.220 --> 00:05.600
Okay.

00:07.020 --> 00:10.060
Eupathisa is a big genus, and in general, it's hard to tell apart.

00:10.060 --> 00:18.460
But those that I mentioned and the Navidata group, I have so little confidence.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.320
I think most of them are Navidata.

00:20.820 --> 00:29.460
And I think it's highly possible that Navidata is variable in these genitalia as well as

00:29.460 --> 00:36.280
patterns, so it's possible that these characters are not valid, that have been used to separate

00:36.280 --> 00:36.460
them.

00:36.460 --> 00:44.560
And none of these people who did the monographs did DNA studies, which is unfortunate.

00:44.880 --> 00:50.540
That would have provided additional evidence as to the validity of the species.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.540
Gillata is easy to recognize.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.060
That's a winner.

00:59.460 --> 01:07.480
After lunch, Navidata is mostly a winter moth, but it flies, has a longer flight season.

01:09.860 --> 01:19.140
McDonough, I probably confused some of them with the most common species, which is Nistarata.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.860
But now I know how to tell them apart and don't make mistakes anymore.

01:24.860 --> 01:30.080
McDonough, I've got in Davis.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.840
I just got Navidata for the first time in Davis this year.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.120
Mistosa, there's a similar species.

01:38.120 --> 01:47.760
And Bill Patterson at Quail Ridge was calling it by the similar species name.

01:48.220 --> 01:49.500
But I did the dissections.

01:50.260 --> 01:57.480
And it turned out that Volte's paper with illustrations of the labial palps show a difference, which

01:57.480 --> 02:00.160
confirmed that my ID was correct.

02:00.160 --> 02:15.460
I sent specimens to Ferris when he was doing his study, and he'd never, he just said, they

02:15.460 --> 02:19.140
looked to me like Melissa, where I wasn't sure whether they were that.

02:19.140 --> 02:25.240
But the genitalia of it and another species are very similar to one another.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.980
And I was never completely comfortable calling it one or the other.

02:29.980 --> 02:42.540
And I'm not sure that Ferris correctly resolved the identity crisis either.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.880
He's used to be in a different genus.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.320
Prorella, I believe.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.960
And they fly in the spring or early summer.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.240
I can't remember which.

02:56.240 --> 03:02.580
And I think all the ones I collected, I collected on the canyon floor.

03:03.600 --> 03:11.320
So that may account for records in some years and not in other years.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.940
Eupathisia mendicata.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.360
That's the tiny one.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.840
And Ferris did not agree in the identification here.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.000
But the genitalia suggests that it's mendicata.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.580
But there are other small species that are very similar.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.360
And I didn't dissect every individual.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.440
It's a common one.

03:36.460 --> 03:44.080
So I believe it's mostly mendicata because everyone that I dissected was mendicata.

03:44.080 --> 03:57.960
And, um, but, um, for instance, Mariah Robinson called her something else when she collected them at McLaughlin.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.060
But she didn't do any, any dissection she did, I did for her.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.440
I don't know that I dissected any of her specimens.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.760
I think she was calling it Minuta.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.340
And, uh, Ferris said they're not small enough to be this.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.400
These used to be in a different genus, Nassus sinus, but not anymore.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.600
Eupathisia mysterata is the most common species.

04:25.780 --> 04:26.940
And you get it throughout the year.

04:26.940 --> 04:31.740
And in my yard, I collected some on lupine.

04:32.540 --> 04:43.180
But I know that they've also been reared from, uh, plants in completely different families.

04:43.180 --> 04:49.680
So I think it's somewhat of a generalist, which is why it's so successful.

04:49.680 --> 04:57.140
So, segregata is, um, you know, Ferris wrote that this is a hard moth to ID.

04:57.300 --> 05:05.380
But to me, it's an easy moth to ID because it has tufts on the abdomen, tufts of scales on the abdomen.

05:06.340 --> 05:13.760
And even when the wings get worn, there's kind of a characteristic pattern that's recognizable.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.360
And, uh, fairly common.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.180
I get it.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.540
Rarely in Davis.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.060
Sub-epicata is very easy to recognize.

05:27.740 --> 05:32.260
But there is an almost identical species in Southern California.

05:33.720 --> 05:39.160
Um, but the genitalia of the two species are completely different from one another.

05:40.020 --> 05:43.320
So if, um, is that all about that genus?

05:43.380 --> 05:44.880
Because if so, let's cut off here.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.180
Maybe one, is there?

05:46.180 --> 05:46.920
There's one more.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.180
Okay.

05:47.180 --> 05:47.480
Zalmira.

05:49.040 --> 05:49.560
Zalmira.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.820
I've got once in Davis.

05:52.340 --> 05:59.920
Um, this again is one that looks a little bit like some of the species of so-called species

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
Nevidata.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.300
Um, but to me, this one is more distinct.

06:05.300 --> 06:10.040
So, I believe they've all been correctly identified.

06:10.040 --> 06:18.100
I dissected enough of them to know that those that I dissected and called Zalmira are that species

06:18.100 --> 06:19.740
and not a similar-looking one.

06:19.740 --> 06:24.540
So, are we going to quit at this point?

06:24.540 --> 06:24.880
Yeah.

06:24.980 --> 06:25.120
Uh, yeah.

06:25.120 --> 06:25.180
Yeah.

06:25.180 --> 06:25.620
Yeah.

06:25.620 --> 06:25.720
Yeah.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.240
Yeah.

06:26.240 --> 06:26.360
Yeah.

06:26.440 --> 06:26.940
Yeah.

06:26.940 --> 06:28.360
Yeah.

06:40.440 --> 06:40.560
Yeah.
