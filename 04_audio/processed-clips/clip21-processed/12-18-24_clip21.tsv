0	4660	Good going for a little bit, and I'll record number three, and I will go check Ani Lozeth.
5220	5600	Okay.
7020	10060	Eupathisa is a big genus, and in general, it's hard to tell apart.
10060	18460	But those that I mentioned and the Navidata group, I have so little confidence.
18740	20320	I think most of them are Navidata.
20820	29460	And I think it's highly possible that Navidata is variable in these genitalia as well as
29460	36280	patterns, so it's possible that these characters are not valid, that have been used to separate
36280	36460	them.
36460	44560	And none of these people who did the monographs did DNA studies, which is unfortunate.
44880	50540	That would have provided additional evidence as to the validity of the species.
52140	54540	Gillata is easy to recognize.
56720	58060	That's a winner.
59460	67480	After lunch, Navidata is mostly a winter moth, but it flies, has a longer flight season.
69860	79140	McDonough, I probably confused some of them with the most common species, which is Nistarata.
79840	84860	But now I know how to tell them apart and don't make mistakes anymore.
84860	90080	McDonough, I've got in Davis.
90080	93840	I just got Navidata for the first time in Davis this year.
94960	98120	Mistosa, there's a similar species.
98120	107760	And Bill Patterson at Quail Ridge was calling it by the similar species name.
108220	109500	But I did the dissections.
110260	117480	And it turned out that Volte's paper with illustrations of the labial palps show a difference, which
117480	120160	confirmed that my ID was correct.
120160	135460	I sent specimens to Ferris when he was doing his study, and he'd never, he just said, they
135460	139140	looked to me like Melissa, where I wasn't sure whether they were that.
139140	145240	But the genitalia of it and another species are very similar to one another.
145660	149980	And I was never completely comfortable calling it one or the other.
149980	162540	And I'm not sure that Ferris correctly resolved the identity crisis either.
163020	164880	He's used to be in a different genus.
168060	169320	Prorella, I believe.
169680	174960	And they fly in the spring or early summer.
175080	176240	I can't remember which.
176240	182580	And I think all the ones I collected, I collected on the canyon floor.
183600	191320	So that may account for records in some years and not in other years.
194560	195940	Eupathisia mendicata.
196080	197360	That's the tiny one.
197800	202840	And Ferris did not agree in the identification here.
202840	207000	But the genitalia suggests that it's mendicata.
207520	211580	But there are other small species that are very similar.
212120	214360	And I didn't dissect every individual.
214520	215440	It's a common one.
216460	224080	So I believe it's mostly mendicata because everyone that I dissected was mendicata.
224080	237960	And, um, but, um, for instance, Mariah Robinson called her something else when she collected them at McLaughlin.
238320	242060	But she didn't do any, any dissection she did, I did for her.
243140	246440	I don't know that I dissected any of her specimens.
246440	248760	I think she was calling it Minuta.
251040	256340	And, uh, Ferris said they're not small enough to be this.
256720	260400	These used to be in a different genus, Nassus sinus, but not anymore.
262280	265600	Eupathisia mysterata is the most common species.
265780	266940	And you get it throughout the year.
266940	271740	And in my yard, I collected some on lupine.
272540	283180	But I know that they've also been reared from, uh, plants in completely different families.
283180	289680	So I think it's somewhat of a generalist, which is why it's so successful.
289680	297140	So, segregata is, um, you know, Ferris wrote that this is a hard moth to ID.
297300	305380	But to me, it's an easy moth to ID because it has tufts on the abdomen, tufts of scales on the abdomen.
306340	313760	And even when the wings get worn, there's kind of a characteristic pattern that's recognizable.
315380	317360	And, uh, fairly common.
317360	318180	I get it.
319680	321540	Rarely in Davis.
323620	327060	Sub-epicata is very easy to recognize.
327740	332260	But there is an almost identical species in Southern California.
333720	339160	Um, but the genitalia of the two species are completely different from one another.
340020	343320	So if, um, is that all about that genus?
343380	344880	Because if so, let's cut off here.
345380	346180	Maybe one, is there?
346180	346920	There's one more.
347000	347180	Okay.
347180	347480	Zalmira.
349040	349560	Zalmira.
350100	351820	I've got once in Davis.
352340	359920	Um, this again is one that looks a little bit like some of the species of so-called species
359920	360920	Nevidata.
360920	365300	Um, but to me, this one is more distinct.
365300	370040	So, I believe they've all been correctly identified.
370040	378100	I dissected enough of them to know that those that I dissected and called Zalmira are that species
378100	379740	and not a similar-looking one.
379740	384540	So, are we going to quit at this point?
384540	384880	Yeah.
384980	385120	Uh, yeah.
385120	385180	Yeah.
385180	385620	Yeah.
385620	385720	Yeah.
385800	386240	Yeah.
386240	386360	Yeah.
386440	386940	Yeah.
386940	388360	Yeah.
400440	400560	Yeah.
