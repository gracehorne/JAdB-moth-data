1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Good going for a little bit, and I'll record number three, and I will go check Ani Lozeth.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,060
Eupathisa is a big genus, and in general, it's hard to tell apart.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:18,460
But those that I mentioned and the Navidata group, I have so little confidence.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,320
I think most of them are Navidata.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,460
And I think it's highly possible that Navidata is variable in these genitalia as well as

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,280
patterns, so it's possible that these characters are not valid, that have been used to separate

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,460
them.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,560
And none of these people who did the monographs did DNA studies, which is unfortunate.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,540
That would have provided additional evidence as to the validity of the species.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,540
Gillata is easy to recognize.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,060
That's a winner.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,480
After lunch, Navidata is mostly a winter moth, but it flies, has a longer flight season.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:19,140
McDonough, I probably confused some of them with the most common species, which is Nistarata.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,860
But now I know how to tell them apart and don't make mistakes anymore.

16
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,080
McDonough, I've got in Davis.

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,840
I just got Navidata for the first time in Davis this year.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,120
Mistosa, there's a similar species.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:47,760
And Bill Patterson at Quail Ridge was calling it by the similar species name.

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,500
But I did the dissections.

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:57,480
And it turned out that Volte's paper with illustrations of the labial palps show a difference, which

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,160
confirmed that my ID was correct.

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:15,460
I sent specimens to Ferris when he was doing his study, and he'd never, he just said, they

24
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,140
looked to me like Melissa, where I wasn't sure whether they were that.

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,240
But the genitalia of it and another species are very similar to one another.

26
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,980
And I was never completely comfortable calling it one or the other.

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:42,540
And I'm not sure that Ferris correctly resolved the identity crisis either.

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,880
He's used to be in a different genus.

29
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,320
Prorella, I believe.

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,960
And they fly in the spring or early summer.

31
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,240
I can't remember which.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,580
And I think all the ones I collected, I collected on the canyon floor.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,320
So that may account for records in some years and not in other years.

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,940
Eupathisia mendicata.

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
That's the tiny one.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,840
And Ferris did not agree in the identification here.

37
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,000
But the genitalia suggests that it's mendicata.

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,580
But there are other small species that are very similar.

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,360
And I didn't dissect every individual.

40
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,440
It's a common one.

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:44,080
So I believe it's mostly mendicata because everyone that I dissected was mendicata.

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:57,960
And, um, but, um, for instance, Mariah Robinson called her something else when she collected them at McLaughlin.

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,060
But she didn't do any, any dissection she did, I did for her.

44
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,440
I don't know that I dissected any of her specimens.

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,760
I think she was calling it Minuta.

46
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,340
And, uh, Ferris said they're not small enough to be this.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
These used to be in a different genus, Nassus sinus, but not anymore.

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,600
Eupathisia mysterata is the most common species.

49
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
And you get it throughout the year.

50
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,740
And in my yard, I collected some on lupine.

51
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:43,180
But I know that they've also been reared from, uh, plants in completely different families.

52
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,680
So I think it's somewhat of a generalist, which is why it's so successful.

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,140
So, segregata is, um, you know, Ferris wrote that this is a hard moth to ID.

54
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:05,380
But to me, it's an easy moth to ID because it has tufts on the abdomen, tufts of scales on the abdomen.

55
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:13,760
And even when the wings get worn, there's kind of a characteristic pattern that's recognizable.

56
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,360
And, uh, fairly common.

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,180
I get it.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,540
Rarely in Davis.

59
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,060
Sub-epicata is very easy to recognize.

60
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,260
But there is an almost identical species in Southern California.

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,160
Um, but the genitalia of the two species are completely different from one another.

62
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,320
So if, um, is that all about that genus?

63
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,880
Because if so, let's cut off here.

64
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,180
Maybe one, is there?

65
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,920
There's one more.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,180
Okay.

67
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,480
Zalmira.

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,560
Zalmira.

69
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,820
I've got once in Davis.

70
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,920
Um, this again is one that looks a little bit like some of the species of so-called species

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Nevidata.

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,300
Um, but to me, this one is more distinct.

73
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,040
So, I believe they've all been correctly identified.

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:18,100
I dissected enough of them to know that those that I dissected and called Zalmira are that species

75
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,740
and not a similar-looking one.

76
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,540
So, are we going to quit at this point?

77
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah.

78
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,120
Uh, yeah.

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,180
Yeah.

80
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah.

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah.

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Yeah.

84
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,940
Yeah.

85
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah.

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Yeah.
