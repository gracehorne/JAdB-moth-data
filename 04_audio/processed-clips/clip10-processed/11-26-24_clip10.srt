1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, starting back up.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
On to Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,440
This is a Blastobasin and it disappeared completely in my yard for a while and then reappeared.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:41,120
Blastobases in general, most Blastobases seem to get into like abandoned feeding shelters of other Lepidoptera.

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:56,380
So they kind of scavenge the remains, you know, frass and just debris left behind by others.

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:07,180
And they're hard to find if you look for the larvae, but I got a number of them just by clipping branches one time

7
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,520
and bringing them into the lab, sticking it in their bag and Blastobases came out.

8
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,760
But Pigridia, Pigridiines, I think, are more prone to be specialists.

9
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,320
And this moth looks like pictures of Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,100
And for a while, Moth Photographers Group showed its distribution to be in California,

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,320
then removed it, and now I think it's brought it back again.

12
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:44,120
So I don't know whether what I'm calling Pigridia and Mert-Feldela is that species or not.

13
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,140
So there's some doubt as to the specific identification.

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:02:01,500
The second thing is some of the pictures online show a form that's different than the ones that I record as Mert-Feldela.

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,160
And they might have been recorded in the wastebasket Blastobases.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,740
So that's a problem.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,760
This might not be complete.

18
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:23,040
If we have the all-gray form, that I wouldn't have recorded as Mert-Feldela.

19
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,180
What would you have recorded it as?

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,420
Do you have another one?

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,740
I call it Blastobases.

22
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,540
What do I call it?

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
Blastobases.

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,300
Unidentified Blastobases.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:33,840
Yeah.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,260
Blastobases have very fancy...

27
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,920
There is a guy who specializes them in the Smithsonian.

28
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,300
I thought about sending them specimens.

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,300
But then I heard that he sits on them forever.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,640
At least, you know, I have the option of at least dissecting them and sorting them out by ones that have similar genitalia.

31
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,120
And I would hope to be able to associate males with females.

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,480
But Blastobases in general are...

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:13,720
There is a character on the antennae that can be used to separate Pigridia from the other genera of Blastobases.

34
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,640
So that might be...

35
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,620
It might not be this species, but it's definitely this genus.

36
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,220
Yeah.

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,400
Jerry originally told me it was Pigridia.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,120
Okay.

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,380
But there might also be other individuals in Blastobases that are actually also this species.

40
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,080
Well, no, there may be other Pigridia that look like Mert Feldella.

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,780
Okay.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,580
Because for some reason, they pulled the dots indicating that there were specimens.

43
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,600
It was known from California, often mouth photographers group.

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,480
And they may have been reinserted.

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know.

46
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,960
So can we call this Pigridia spa?

47
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,520
I call it Pigridia Mert Feldella question mark.

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,220
And we're using the question mark then to indicate discomfort.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,880
See, it has this orange here and a fairly strong band.

50
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,820
And see, now there's no records in the West.

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,520
But the one we get...

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
And if you scroll down...

53
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,220
But, like, the shirts don't fit me if they're small because...

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,860
They don't show...

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,680
They don't show everything up here.

56
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,120
And I'm like, shit!

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,860
They don't show it anymore.

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,560
But the ones I get look exactly like that.

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,680
Aw!

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, my God, the manatees!

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
So, um...

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,980
The manatees are adorable.

63
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,280
It may be that this guy at the Smithsonian says, no, it doesn't occur in the West.

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
But that may be based upon he hadn't seen any specimens from the West.

65
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:44,900
Right.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,740
I mean, you can't...

67
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,120
And people don't send them to him because he sits on them.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:50,900
Yeah.

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,760
When people say this is a distribution, it's really based upon specimens I examined, reports,

70
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,180
or this, that, or the other thing.

71
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,660
And some people are very conservative and will only base it on specimens that they've examined

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,020
where other people base it upon multiple sources.

73
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,700
Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.

75
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,940
And it has a back print, too.

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,460
And it was a...

77
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,980
I don't know that we have it at Cold Kenyon.

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,580
It was originally intercepted at San Francisco Airport.

79
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,080
Hmm, hmm.

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,820
Well, it was originally identified from a specimen that was intercepted at San Francisco Airport.

81
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,840
And it turned out that Jerry had been collecting it in his backyard in Berkeley,

82
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,700
so he was going to write a paper on it.

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,300
Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,320
I think the judge will be.

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,080
And then...

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,140
Yeah.

87
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,900
He found that both I and Greg had specimens from around here,

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,420
and I think Bill had one from Sacramento or something.

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,780
So it turned out here.

90
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,040
And then when the paper went out for review, it went to CDFA.

91
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,060
And it turned out they've been getting hundreds and hundreds of them in cotton fields.

92
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,220
And it's a minor pest of cotton.

93
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,220
And I think it's imported from the Middle East.

94
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:48,340
I think it feeds on Malbaceae.

95
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:58,220
And the abundance kind of comes and goes depending on whether I have hollyhocks in my yard that year or not.

96
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,280
So this could be artificial increase.

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,900
I've been tended to grow hollyhocks.

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,340
Once you grow hollyhocks, you can't get rid of them because they...

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,600
So you think that they're, like, increasing in your yard, and so you're getting more and more of them.

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah.

101
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
So it might not be a regional trend.

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,680
Well, that and other people are planting hollyhocks, too, because they're pretty drought tolerant.

103
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
And they're showy.

104
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:34,360
So, you know, we're in one of those neighborhoods where the residents have adopted landscaping that the city used to do.

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,140
You know, they have that adopted part.

106
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,840
I mean, we're too cheap to keep your neighborhood up anymore.

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,040
Yeah, exactly, because a lot of those people will say, you know, pesticides, they never talk.

108
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Plotinotus stoltana is another introduced pest species.

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,660
I think it's called the omnivorous leaf roller or something like that.

110
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,900
So very seldom at Cove Canyon.

111
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
This is one of those pest species.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,020
Yeah.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,320
And it's found throughout the year.

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,620
The numbers vary from year to year, but I think this is real, that the trend is it's getting increased.

115
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,160
So it's not found in the Bay Area, for example.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,040
Very common here.

117
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,660
Yeah, that's what I was wondering, because, like, the only other reason that I can think of it.

118
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,960
You put that John thinks it's increasing, even though it's not showing up.

119
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,080
He's on a lot of things.

120
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm never asleep.

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,220
I think that's a common name.

122
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm not sure.

123
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,160
Clodia interpunctella is the coddling moth.

124
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,580
And I think it's probably introduced.

125
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,080
And in my yard, it could be on my pluot tree.

126
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,160
But it gets in walnut husk and things like that, too.

127
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,480
So not at all.

128
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,300
Well, I don't know that I have any records from Cove Canyon whatsoever.

129
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,360
And then I was like, that's a lot of old fears.

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,140
And then I was like, what if I did, like, harvestmen?

131
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,240
Flutella xylosella is the diamondback moth.

132
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
There's nothing known about them.

133
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,580
It's all doing a lot of this.

134
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,200
A cosmopolitan species on...

135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,340
Tomato?

136
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,860
Pardon me?

137
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,720
Is it tomato?

138
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Solanaceae?

139
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,380
What?

140
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,200
No, it feeds on the mustard family.

141
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,780
Oh.

142
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,860
Which is surprising.

143
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,920
I don't know.

144
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
I saw one.

145
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,740
Would you say you think it might be declining in Davis?

146
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,800
No, I don't think it is.

147
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Obrus casei.

148
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,500
It seems to enjoy outbursts and then disappear and then come back.

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
And...

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:06,800
There are other native species that look very similar to it.

151
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,680
And I've only recorded one of them.

152
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,620
And I think from my yard.

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:26,860
You know, this is a notorious moth because it was the first one to be shown to have become resistant to BT.

154
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:41,740
So, Grace, we shouldn't be seeing that day positives go up over time, but that we have negative trend, or that we have a negative overall trend, right?

155
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,580
Is it brass acaciae?

156
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
Is that what mustard's like?

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,060
Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,260
It is a cotton.

159
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,420
Isn't it day positives that we wanted on the axis, so that...

160
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Yeah, but it's not fractional day positives for this graph.

161
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:55,940
Got it.

162
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,420
Got it.

163
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,220
So, if collection effort is changing in tandem, it might...

164
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,160
I understand.

165
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay.

166
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,520
One of the host plants is ericimum, wallflower, and fireweed, among the other.

167
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:16,200
And I got a wildflower seed mixture one year, and after I took out one plant in my eye, I just threw these down.

168
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:28,680
And it turned out the only one that has persisted is ericimum, and it reproduces, it replaces itself each year.

169
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:38,420
You know, it dies back, and so it's not a perennial, it's an annual, but it reproduces quite readily from the seed production.

170
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:50,820
But I have a varying amount of offspring each year, so some of this is due to the existence of ericimum in my yard.

171
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:05,020
And it may also be subject to whether people are growing winter vegetables, you know, cabbages and other things.

172
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:17,160
And, you know, some of the weedy mustards are disappearing now that some of the fields are being converted to housing.

173
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,440
But nobody knows where it originated.

174
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,800
It's cosmopolitan, so anywhere where people live, you can find Plutella xylis.

175
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,900
So, you know, Linnaeus described it, so it was already in Europe, and maybe originated in Europe.

176
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:45,780
But some people think that it originated in the New World, because there are a number of very similar species in the New World that are not in the Old World.

177
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,660
No skipper.

178
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,100
Pryognis.

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Pryognis.

180
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
Pryognitis Robinii is a...

181
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,440
Pryognis.

182
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,720
All the ground.

183
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,940
First of seed.

184
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
The family?

185
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,100
The family.

186
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,760
Caussidae.

187
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,480
Caussidae.

188
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,200
Yeah.

189
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Casas are some kind known as goat moth and I always wondered why they were

190
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:26,760
called goat moth and I had a book on South African moths and the larvae are

191
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,960
kind of a pet they go into tree wounds and some of them are capable of boring

192
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:47,560
into healthy trees and the ex scrimma that comes out of the boreholes this it

193
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,880
was was according to one derivation of the name smells like goats has a goaty

194
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,100
odor but I don't know if that's why they're called and this is a very

195
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:06,700
widespread species the male is small and has smaller much smaller than the

196
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:16,660
female and has a horn orange hind wing whereas the female is all gray it's rare

197
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,100
to absent along coastal California for some reason and it just shows up

198
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,900
sporadically in my yard Greg had it fairly common in his yard

199
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:39,220
a dying cherry tree and I think that if you have wounded trees in your yard they

200
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:50,900
are attracted to the tree wounds so I don't know I think the numbers are too low

201
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:59,380
really to identify a trend but possibly

202
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:09,140
Procorodes Truxaliata is a geometrid that feeds on baccarus coyote bush and there was

203
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,300
when I first came here there's a guy from Australia who is investigating this for

204
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:21,980
a possible biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia where it is a major pest coyote

205
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:32,780
bush not the mall and I don't have coyote I don't have baccarus in my yard but there is some in the

206
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:45,100
linear park to the east of the green zone I guess they call it just one block to the east of my house you

207
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,300
know plus Davis pond is one block to the west so there's a lot of coyote bush around both

208
00:15:52,300 --> 00:16:01,020
one both planted ones and non-planted ones so it's around and it shows up fairly regularly

209
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,660
Proxenus Mindara was identified originally by Ron Robertson who was very good on it but he

210
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:22,460
said I'd guess when he identified it so I at some time decided it could be one or the other and

211
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:31,500
possibly both and apparently there's a character in the the genitalia of one species but not the other

212
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,420
is available online so you know when the other ones is available I'll probably dissect them but I set a

213
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:47,260
number aside but whether we have one species or two I don't know but every once in a while they seem to

214
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:59,660
show up in big numbers and then back down for a while this p-r-o-x it starts at Proxenus

215
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:11,180
this along with beet army worm and that carriage line in Montana which I've mentioned they're right

216
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:18,460
next to one another in the checklist and all of them seem to have population like wax and wane from

217
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:25,740
time to time spodoptera seemed yeah spodoptera was still the most common to a metro to buy yard this year

218
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,060
but it was down in numbers do you think that um it's native i think so

219
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,700
but again that's

220
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,260
pirellis farinalis is a

221
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,580
stored it's the grain moth a grain moth or something like it

222
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,420
farina you know farina is what some kind of boiled wheat
