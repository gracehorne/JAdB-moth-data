WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.000
Okay, starting back up.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.400
On to Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.

00:14.400 --> 00:21.440
This is a Blastobasin and it disappeared completely in my yard for a while and then reappeared.

00:21.440 --> 00:41.120
Blastobases in general, most Blastobases seem to get into like abandoned feeding shelters of other Lepidoptera.

00:41.120 --> 00:56.380
So they kind of scavenge the remains, you know, frass and just debris left behind by others.

00:57.880 --> 01:07.180
And they're hard to find if you look for the larvae, but I got a number of them just by clipping branches one time

01:07.180 --> 01:11.520
and bringing them into the lab, sticking it in their bag and Blastobases came out.

01:12.340 --> 01:17.760
But Pigridia, Pigridiines, I think, are more prone to be specialists.

01:18.440 --> 01:23.320
And this moth looks like pictures of Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.

01:24.100 --> 01:30.100
And for a while, Moth Photographers Group showed its distribution to be in California,

01:30.460 --> 01:35.320
then removed it, and now I think it's brought it back again.

01:35.320 --> 01:44.120
So I don't know whether what I'm calling Pigridia and Mert-Feldela is that species or not.

01:44.820 --> 01:48.140
So there's some doubt as to the specific identification.

01:48.880 --> 02:01.500
The second thing is some of the pictures online show a form that's different than the ones that I record as Mert-Feldela.

02:01.500 --> 02:08.160
And they might have been recorded in the wastebasket Blastobases.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.740
So that's a problem.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.760
This might not be complete.

02:14.100 --> 02:23.040
If we have the all-gray form, that I wouldn't have recorded as Mert-Feldela.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.180
What would you have recorded it as?

02:25.400 --> 02:26.420
Do you have another one?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.740
I call it Blastobases.

02:28.740 --> 02:29.540
What do I call it?

02:30.000 --> 02:30.480
Blastobases.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.300
Unidentified Blastobases.

02:33.820 --> 02:33.840
Yeah.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.260
Blastobases have very fancy...

02:38.260 --> 02:41.920
There is a guy who specializes them in the Smithsonian.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.300
I thought about sending them specimens.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.300
But then I heard that he sits on them forever.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.640
At least, you know, I have the option of at least dissecting them and sorting them out by ones that have similar genitalia.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.120
And I would hope to be able to associate males with females.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.480
But Blastobases in general are...

03:03.480 --> 03:13.720
There is a character on the antennae that can be used to separate Pigridia from the other genera of Blastobases.

03:14.940 --> 03:17.640
So that might be...

03:17.640 --> 03:20.620
It might not be this species, but it's definitely this genus.

03:20.980 --> 03:21.220
Yeah.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.400
Jerry originally told me it was Pigridia.

03:24.860 --> 03:25.120
Okay.

03:25.260 --> 03:31.380
But there might also be other individuals in Blastobases that are actually also this species.

03:31.380 --> 03:35.080
Well, no, there may be other Pigridia that look like Mert Feldella.

03:35.420 --> 03:35.780
Okay.

03:36.560 --> 03:43.580
Because for some reason, they pulled the dots indicating that there were specimens.

03:44.020 --> 03:47.600
It was known from California, often mouth photographers group.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.480
And they may have been reinserted.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.000
I don't know.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.960
So can we call this Pigridia spa?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.520
I call it Pigridia Mert Feldella question mark.

03:56.520 --> 04:03.220
And we're using the question mark then to indicate discomfort.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.880
See, it has this orange here and a fairly strong band.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.820
And see, now there's no records in the West.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.520
But the one we get...

04:14.520 --> 04:16.520
And if you scroll down...

04:16.520 --> 04:18.220
But, like, the shirts don't fit me if they're small because...

04:18.220 --> 04:18.860
They don't show...

04:18.860 --> 04:19.680
They don't show everything up here.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.120
And I'm like, shit!

04:22.120 --> 04:22.860
They don't show it anymore.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.560
But the ones I get look exactly like that.

04:27.240 --> 04:27.680
Aw!

04:28.680 --> 04:30.000
Oh, my God, the manatees!

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
So, um...

04:31.360 --> 04:32.980
The manatees are adorable.

04:33.300 --> 04:39.280
It may be that this guy at the Smithsonian says, no, it doesn't occur in the West.

04:39.280 --> 04:44.400
But that may be based upon he hadn't seen any specimens from the West.

04:44.620 --> 04:44.900
Right.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.740
I mean, you can't...

04:47.740 --> 04:50.120
And people don't send them to him because he sits on them.

04:50.660 --> 04:50.900
Yeah.

04:52.280 --> 04:59.760
When people say this is a distribution, it's really based upon specimens I examined, reports,

04:59.940 --> 05:01.180
or this, that, or the other thing.

05:01.180 --> 05:07.660
And some people are very conservative and will only base it on specimens that they've examined

05:07.660 --> 05:13.020
where other people base it upon multiple sources.

05:19.020 --> 05:25.700
Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.700
Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.

05:27.700 --> 05:27.940
And it has a back print, too.

05:29.780 --> 05:33.460
And it was a...

05:33.460 --> 05:37.980
I don't know that we have it at Cold Kenyon.

05:39.200 --> 05:48.580
It was originally intercepted at San Francisco Airport.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.080
Hmm, hmm.

05:50.080 --> 05:57.820
Well, it was originally identified from a specimen that was intercepted at San Francisco Airport.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.840
And it turned out that Jerry had been collecting it in his backyard in Berkeley,

06:02.980 --> 06:04.700
so he was going to write a paper on it.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.300
Oh, yeah.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.320
I think the judge will be.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.080
And then...

06:07.080 --> 06:07.140
Yeah.

06:09.620 --> 06:14.900
He found that both I and Greg had specimens from around here,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.420
and I think Bill had one from Sacramento or something.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.780
So it turned out here.

06:18.780 --> 06:23.040
And then when the paper went out for review, it went to CDFA.

06:23.460 --> 06:27.060
And it turned out they've been getting hundreds and hundreds of them in cotton fields.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.220
And it's a minor pest of cotton.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.220
And I think it's imported from the Middle East.

06:34.220 --> 06:48.340
I think it feeds on Malbaceae.

06:48.780 --> 06:58.220
And the abundance kind of comes and goes depending on whether I have hollyhocks in my yard that year or not.

06:58.220 --> 07:02.280
So this could be artificial increase.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.900
I've been tended to grow hollyhocks.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.340
Once you grow hollyhocks, you can't get rid of them because they...

07:08.340 --> 07:13.600
So you think that they're, like, increasing in your yard, and so you're getting more and more of them.

07:13.600 --> 07:13.760
Yeah.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.120
So it might not be a regional trend.

07:15.500 --> 07:20.680
Well, that and other people are planting hollyhocks, too, because they're pretty drought tolerant.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.020
And they're showy.

07:22.020 --> 07:34.360
So, you know, we're in one of those neighborhoods where the residents have adopted landscaping that the city used to do.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.140
You know, they have that adopted part.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.840
I mean, we're too cheap to keep your neighborhood up anymore.

07:40.840 --> 07:45.040
Yeah, exactly, because a lot of those people will say, you know, pesticides, they never talk.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.040
Plotinotus stoltana is another introduced pest species.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.660
I think it's called the omnivorous leaf roller or something like that.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.900
So very seldom at Cove Canyon.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.600
This is one of those pest species.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.020
Yeah.

08:00.840 --> 08:08.320
And it's found throughout the year.

08:08.320 --> 08:14.620
The numbers vary from year to year, but I think this is real, that the trend is it's getting increased.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.160
So it's not found in the Bay Area, for example.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.040
Very common here.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.660
Yeah, that's what I was wondering, because, like, the only other reason that I can think of it.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.960
You put that John thinks it's increasing, even though it's not showing up.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.080
He's on a lot of things.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.340
I'm never asleep.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.220
I think that's a common name.

08:30.280 --> 08:30.840
I'm not sure.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.160
Clodia interpunctella is the coddling moth.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.580
And I think it's probably introduced.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.080
And in my yard, it could be on my pluot tree.

08:49.220 --> 08:54.160
But it gets in walnut husk and things like that, too.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.480
So not at all.

08:56.480 --> 09:01.300
Well, I don't know that I have any records from Cove Canyon whatsoever.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.360
And then I was like, that's a lot of old fears.

09:03.880 --> 09:08.140
And then I was like, what if I did, like, harvestmen?

09:08.920 --> 09:12.240
Flutella xylosella is the diamondback moth.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.360
There's nothing known about them.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.580
It's all doing a lot of this.

09:14.580 --> 09:17.200
A cosmopolitan species on...

09:17.200 --> 09:18.340
Tomato?

09:19.220 --> 09:19.860
Pardon me?

09:19.860 --> 09:20.720
Is it tomato?

09:21.720 --> 09:22.480
Solanaceae?

09:23.260 --> 09:23.380
What?

09:23.540 --> 09:27.200
No, it feeds on the mustard family.

09:27.500 --> 09:27.780
Oh.

09:29.120 --> 09:29.860
Which is surprising.

09:30.100 --> 09:30.920
I don't know.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.200
I saw one.

09:34.580 --> 09:37.740
Would you say you think it might be declining in Davis?

09:37.740 --> 09:41.800
No, I don't think it is.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.560
Obrus casei.

09:45.380 --> 09:50.500
It seems to enjoy outbursts and then disappear and then come back.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
And...

09:52.500 --> 10:06.800
There are other native species that look very similar to it.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.680
And I've only recorded one of them.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.620
And I think from my yard.

10:16.660 --> 10:26.860
You know, this is a notorious moth because it was the first one to be shown to have become resistant to BT.

10:26.860 --> 10:41.740
So, Grace, we shouldn't be seeing that day positives go up over time, but that we have negative trend, or that we have a negative overall trend, right?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.580
Is it brass acaciae?

10:44.680 --> 10:46.000
Is that what mustard's like?

10:46.000 --> 10:46.060
Mm-hmm.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.260
It is a cotton.

10:47.260 --> 10:52.420
Isn't it day positives that we wanted on the axis, so that...

10:52.420 --> 10:55.420
Yeah, but it's not fractional day positives for this graph.

10:55.580 --> 10:55.940
Got it.

10:56.120 --> 10:56.420
Got it.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.220
So, if collection effort is changing in tandem, it might...

10:59.220 --> 11:00.160
I understand.

11:00.160 --> 11:00.520
Okay.

11:01.260 --> 11:05.520
One of the host plants is ericimum, wallflower, and fireweed, among the other.

11:07.060 --> 11:16.200
And I got a wildflower seed mixture one year, and after I took out one plant in my eye, I just threw these down.

11:16.200 --> 11:28.680
And it turned out the only one that has persisted is ericimum, and it reproduces, it replaces itself each year.

11:28.860 --> 11:38.420
You know, it dies back, and so it's not a perennial, it's an annual, but it reproduces quite readily from the seed production.

11:38.420 --> 11:50.820
But I have a varying amount of offspring each year, so some of this is due to the existence of ericimum in my yard.

11:51.480 --> 12:05.020
And it may also be subject to whether people are growing winter vegetables, you know, cabbages and other things.

12:05.020 --> 12:17.160
And, you know, some of the weedy mustards are disappearing now that some of the fields are being converted to housing.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.440
But nobody knows where it originated.

12:23.820 --> 12:29.800
It's cosmopolitan, so anywhere where people live, you can find Plutella xylis.

12:29.800 --> 12:34.900
So, you know, Linnaeus described it, so it was already in Europe, and maybe originated in Europe.

12:35.520 --> 12:45.780
But some people think that it originated in the New World, because there are a number of very similar species in the New World that are not in the Old World.

12:47.780 --> 12:48.660
No skipper.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.100
Pryognis.

12:52.120 --> 12:52.320
Pryognis.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.400
Pryognitis Robinii is a...

12:55.060 --> 12:56.440
Pryognis.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.720
All the ground.

13:02.080 --> 13:02.940
First of seed.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.400
The family?

13:08.260 --> 13:09.100
The family.

13:10.980 --> 13:11.760
Caussidae.

13:11.940 --> 13:12.480
Caussidae.

13:12.740 --> 13:13.200
Yeah.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.760
Casas are some kind known as goat moth and I always wondered why they were

13:17.760 --> 13:26.760
called goat moth and I had a book on South African moths and the larvae are

13:26.760 --> 13:34.960
kind of a pet they go into tree wounds and some of them are capable of boring

13:34.960 --> 13:47.560
into healthy trees and the ex scrimma that comes out of the boreholes this it

13:47.560 --> 13:54.880
was was according to one derivation of the name smells like goats has a goaty

13:54.880 --> 14:00.100
odor but I don't know if that's why they're called and this is a very

14:00.100 --> 14:06.700
widespread species the male is small and has smaller much smaller than the

14:06.700 --> 14:16.660
female and has a horn orange hind wing whereas the female is all gray it's rare

14:16.660 --> 14:23.100
to absent along coastal California for some reason and it just shows up

14:23.100 --> 14:28.900
sporadically in my yard Greg had it fairly common in his yard

14:28.900 --> 14:39.220
a dying cherry tree and I think that if you have wounded trees in your yard they

14:39.220 --> 14:50.900
are attracted to the tree wounds so I don't know I think the numbers are too low

14:50.900 --> 14:59.380
really to identify a trend but possibly

14:59.380 --> 15:09.140
Procorodes Truxaliata is a geometrid that feeds on baccarus coyote bush and there was

15:09.140 --> 15:14.300
when I first came here there's a guy from Australia who is investigating this for

15:14.300 --> 15:21.980
a possible biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia where it is a major pest coyote

15:21.980 --> 15:32.780
bush not the mall and I don't have coyote I don't have baccarus in my yard but there is some in the

15:32.780 --> 15:45.100
linear park to the east of the green zone I guess they call it just one block to the east of my house you

15:45.100 --> 15:52.300
know plus Davis pond is one block to the west so there's a lot of coyote bush around both

15:52.300 --> 16:01.020
one both planted ones and non-planted ones so it's around and it shows up fairly regularly

16:03.980 --> 16:11.660
Proxenus Mindara was identified originally by Ron Robertson who was very good on it but he

16:11.660 --> 16:22.460
said I'd guess when he identified it so I at some time decided it could be one or the other and

16:22.460 --> 16:31.500
possibly both and apparently there's a character in the the genitalia of one species but not the other

16:31.500 --> 16:39.420
is available online so you know when the other ones is available I'll probably dissect them but I set a

16:39.420 --> 16:47.260
number aside but whether we have one species or two I don't know but every once in a while they seem to

16:48.140 --> 16:59.660
show up in big numbers and then back down for a while this p-r-o-x it starts at Proxenus

16:59.660 --> 17:11.180
this along with beet army worm and that carriage line in Montana which I've mentioned they're right

17:11.180 --> 17:18.460
next to one another in the checklist and all of them seem to have population like wax and wane from

17:18.460 --> 17:25.740
time to time spodoptera seemed yeah spodoptera was still the most common to a metro to buy yard this year

17:25.740 --> 17:32.060
but it was down in numbers do you think that um it's native i think so
