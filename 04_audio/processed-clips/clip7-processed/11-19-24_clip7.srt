1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
we're at homeosoma electella yes thank you guys sorry i have to run away sure

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
this is another sunflower boss and

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,280
for some reason it's a variable species but the western ones around here are all kind of

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,280
glossy looking and look different but ones that i collected early in the year

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:34,000
look like ones from out of our area which are more uh kind of granular looking i don't know how to

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,640
expect they look like sand you know desert sand or something rather than shiny and somewhat tan

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,960
but it turns out there's a second species here called homeosoma oslorellum

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:02,000
okay and in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones yeah i'll be there in about 10 minutes

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,320
um in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,960
they turned out to be oslorellum and may have been recorded as uh electoa oh so do not trust but i

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:25,360
save most of them so it may be possible to go back and determine whether they are oslorellum or

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:34,080
electilla and i saved them because they did look so different than the shinier moth um that tends to

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,160
fly later in the year or at least build up in numbers until later in the year

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,640
so that's something that we can put on the back burner

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,000
but you know in the first monograph on visa times the author of that commented that there was lots of

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,360
different forms of electella but he may not have realized that there was more than one species when he

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:10,800
he made that comment hyleus phyleus hyalephala phyleus is a skipper a butterfly it's native

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,920
but it's a lawn moth so it seems to be found in urban areas on lawns

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:32,240
uh and it turns up on light at light on hot nights as long as well as a very similar looking lawn moth

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,840
that is probably native whereas this i'm less sure as native i don't know art could probably

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
give you more information on the skippers the other one is that atalapides campestras

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,120
which we may have i don't know whether you included it or not

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,360
it would only be at davis i never got skippers at cold canyon at light yeah i don't think that one was

24
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,840
included

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
no atalapides was not in there

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,440
though it may not be an atalapides anymore butterfly taxonomy is like changes all the time chasing a

27
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
dragonfly you just can't catch it

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
okay where was i

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,200
the skipper ohyleus lineata

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,520
that's a syngid that's the line sphinx white line sphinx yeah yeah and it migrates out of

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,600
deserts particularly in drought years and when it does it shows up in a

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:04:03,280
a mostly early in the year and um with a greater range of size than when it's non-migratory

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,800
so

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,640
greater numbers may indicate drought and desert areas

35
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,640
i mean i've been in places in southern california where the caterpillars are like

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,120
teeming all over the place everywhere you walk so it's just crazy uh and then they migrate because

37
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:46,320
they in bad years or caterpillars outnumber food sources they're out of town the sinopolia olivacea

38
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,320
um i need to confirm the identity because there's another species which i first reported last year

39
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,640
the name of which i can't recall off the top of my head

40
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,320
the illustrations of the genitalia are available so i would be able to confirm it

41
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,240
but i haven't been getting this in recent years as frequently as greg has in his yard but this

42
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,680
is one of those species that flies late and now with more late collecting nights i would have expected

43
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,840
it to be turning up more frequently rather than less frequently so why it disappeared is

44
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
due to something other than climate change i think

45
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,840
do you know it's food plant i think it's

46
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,960
feeds on various trees and shrubs as is the case with most of these live in sinopolia

47
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,120
but i'd have to look that up

48
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,320
the sinopolia quadrilineata is the most common species here in davis

49
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:09,680
um extremely common in some years the mid the early season ones are larger than the late season ones

50
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,000
which are often considerably smaller than the early season ones

51
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,520
but i i think that's just generations of the same moth and maybe the post plant quality is

52
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
and availability goes down later in the year

53
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,240
leucania

54
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,120
wajacana leucania is a difficult genus most of the species are very similar to one another

55
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
and i've been calling this wajacana on the basis of

56
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:54,480
um identification by somebody who is notorious for misidentifying moths but it does match a

57
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,840
descriptions of the moth on a website which has recently been deleted from the internet

58
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,400
oh no

59
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
what happened was there was a specialist in the group and he tried to

60
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,760
characterize the moth without using the genitalia as a character you know where i would have rather

61
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,840
seen the genitalia so i could confirm what they are but but now everything's gone so

62
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,440
lucca goniella californica and distincta is a very small gala kid and

63
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,400
might be a scavenger or might feed on like grains and seeds and things like that

64
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
it turns up in weird situation in some years is extremely common

65
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:59,440
um not so common this year so i don't know what's going on with it and i cannot tell the species apart

66
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,800
by looking at them whereas you see pictures of ones that haven't been dissected posted on the internet

67
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,640
so i don't how can you tell i don't trust those photos of undissected moths unless you know that they were

68
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:26,400
dissected um subsequently and they look like some species and other genera so this is kind of a

69
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,240
wastebasket i did dissect a few and i think all the ones in davis were one species or the other whereas

70
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:46,000
at cold canyon i found both species by up to ladies is a tiny um terra for it and

71
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,560
its abundance seems to vary from year to year but in general there seems to be fewer than in recent

72
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,320
years than i was getting some years ago but your data suggests that is this inclining or decline uh

73
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:12,080
declining the red is declining so that's what i sensed that it's in decline and some of them are

74
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:21,680
much smaller than others so it may be that host plant quality affects the size of them some moths are

75
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:31,200
very consistent in size or others not so much my machinia rufofascialis is a widespread

76
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,560
pyralid moth and it's turned up in varying amounts like you see it in the sierra

77
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
much more commonly than you do here in the valley and

78
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,560
it seemed to me that it disappeared for a while but i got a couple

79
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,440
you know more than two or three in recent years once again disappeared completely for the most part for

80
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:10,240
some time i don't know it's biology how's it going god hi grace hi how's it going cold yeah it's very

81
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:19,680
cold out well we're we'll quit around 10. momphus cephalanthi aloe was um is a tiny momphid and

82
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:29,520
momphids are specialists on uh evening primrose family but i just grab your stuff i don't know whether

83
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:38,720
cephalanthus is in that family or not let's see i'd have to look that up but i assume that's the food plant

84
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:49,680
uh it's in rubesi it's in what rubesi yeah an evening primrose family is on a gracie yeah

85
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,280
on a gracie i think yeah yeah so this is kind of an odd one and it's considerably smaller than the

86
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:05,840
other momphids half the size so and uh pal identified it you know and i asked him are you

87
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,880
sure and he says well it looks like it and that's so it's the name he used

88
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,760
momphid species 10 um i sent these off because i to the specialists on momphids

89
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:31,600
because i thought they were momphids or elakistis i'm sorry and he sent them right back said that they're

90
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,920
other momphids but probably in unidentified species and i think wagner reared this from

91
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:53,200
grasses in his yard in berkeley but i'm not 100 sure about that but uh it's varied in abundance over the

92
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,280
years but does seem to be in decline as your analyses suggests

93
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,640
the nofis cross the capitella is a tinea that might be introduced

94
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:23,920
and it's distinctive so this is one of the tineas that i'm certain of the identification

95
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,520
and

96
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,120
as your data suggests it does seem to have declined in recent years

97
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:46,880
let's finish this page and then we'll call it quits so sounds good methimna unipuncta

98
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,080
widespread species but studies studies in europe shows that there's both a

99
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,000
non-migratory and migratory populations of it and the migratory ones show up in the fall

100
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,160
and indeed i do get a lot of them in the fall but whether that's due to the native population

101
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,880
building up in numbers or migration ones coming in it's got a common name

102
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,960
yellow striped army worm or i think it's an army worm yeah and it's can be confused with lucania

103
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,840
okay and also moss in the genus alicia but

104
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,160
i'm fairly certain that most if not all have been correctly identified

105
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,600
and also the same for what i've been calling lucania which could be more than one species

106
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,360
and maybe a different one noctua pro nuvo is a recent

107
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:06,080
um invader invasive species and greg got one in his yard was the first one in davis a year before

108
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,560
i got it in my yard and it seemed to be increasing in abundance and now reaching more

109
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:20,800
more consistent numbers and it's prolificus um was introduced from europe and was making

110
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,360
almost predictable progress from the east coast where it first showed up across the u.s and then

111
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:39,200
suddenly jumped into california around 2000 2002 or so so it's a an invasive species that we detected

112
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
during this survey

113
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
nomophila neartica

114
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,880
was in pretty good numbers at the beginning of my survey then dropped off and then showed up again

115
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
from time from time to time feeds on low growing plants so it may be

116
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
maybe one that

117
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,680
abundance is related to rainfall so you know that's something you might look for if there's a correlation

118
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,840
there

119
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,080
and it does have a light long flight season

120
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,080
i think this year was a reasonably you know slightly more than average but

121
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,360
it's hard to know you know unless you index it for the frequency of collecting which i think your

122
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,040
program does yeah yeah these are just raw counts but yeah but you know also because it has a long flight

123
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,920
season you get the extremes are going to be out there but most of them fly mid-year

124
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,320
a label on the box awesome thank you so much that was okay we're making progress we're making progress

125
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,640
good
