WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:10.600
Okay. Peripediasia. Peripediasia tetarellus is the common long moth.

00:10.600 --> 00:19.080
Consequently, we don't see it at Cold Canyon. Or if we have, it's only been an

00:19.080 --> 00:29.000
odd specimen here and there. It replaced the native long moth. And this year it

00:29.000 --> 00:36.200
seemed to be down in numbers a little bit. But in general, it's fairly common.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.720
And maybe this trend that you're seeing of it disappearing is because people are

00:41.720 --> 00:44.720
taking their lines up.

00:44.720 --> 00:49.920
That's interesting.

00:49.920 --> 00:59.600
Peripediasia. Some forms of feltia subterranea look very similar to

00:59.600 --> 01:07.920
Peripediasia. But the hind wing is kind of a giveaway for this one. And I rely pretty heavily

01:07.920 --> 01:17.200
on hind wing. The hind wing of this one is kind of a bluish pearl essence. So it's kind

01:17.200 --> 01:28.800
of like a blue oil slip or something. Big moth throughout the year. I think it has a common

01:28.800 --> 01:35.360
name. And I think it's a generalist. And it's a, I think it's a cutworm. So the larva is in the soil.

01:35.360 --> 01:40.480
Would you consider it a pest?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.720
Occasional pest.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.000
I mean, anything's a pest if it eats something you want.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.960
Yeah. Cutworms, you know, are sometimes pests of cut flowers because they cut the flower before

01:56.960 --> 02:01.760
you do. You know, they're cutworms because they cut things off at the stem.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.920
Periploca ceanothiella and Periploca juniperi

02:07.920 --> 02:15.680
are very difficult to tell from one another just based on appearance.

02:18.480 --> 02:26.560
Ceanothiella is, the name suggests fees on ceanothus. It's larger and flies earlier in the year.

02:27.680 --> 02:36.560
Chiniperi is smaller and flies later in the year. They're both black, shiny, shiny black species. And

02:38.480 --> 02:45.440
the person who did the monograph on the family Cosmopterigina suggested that the sheen has a

02:45.440 --> 02:55.680
different appearance to it. But they don't all shine. So there's some that I continue to

02:57.280 --> 03:04.320
record as either or. And the reason for that is they're in, they're kind of,

03:04.320 --> 03:11.920
not that hard. Neither real small nor less small. Even, these are not big. They're all small moths.

03:11.920 --> 03:18.640
So there aren't reliable characteristics? Genitalia. Oh, okay. And I have dissected a number of both.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.080
And I have, you know, even though they're small moths, I've been fortunate to have not

03:24.080 --> 03:31.520
mess them up while I dissected them. And they're clearly we have juniperi. And clearly we have

03:31.520 --> 03:37.920
Ceanothiella. But whether we have any of the other paripoca species, that's a possibility.

03:37.920 --> 03:44.960
There was one from Cold Canyon that I dissected that I couldn't identify. It didn't match up

03:44.960 --> 03:50.480
well with any of the illustrations of the monograph. Juniperi, you know, we discussed this

03:50.480 --> 03:58.320
before. There's no native conifers in the valley. It's described from Sacramento. So it was probably

03:59.680 --> 04:11.840
introduced on ornamental junipers. And ornamental junipers are kind of a good child tolerant plant.

04:11.840 --> 04:19.600
So you can tell, like, the entire ecological history of this region through the lens of the moths.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.040
That's right. I didn't hear you. You could tell the entire ecological

04:23.040 --> 04:32.320
history of this region through the lens of moths. Well, you can find reasons to explain things.

04:32.320 --> 04:38.640
Right. Well, that's what stories are. It's just so cool how they do different things.

04:38.640 --> 04:48.800
Okay. So I still record some as either or. Okay. So that would mean that not every specimen

04:48.800 --> 04:56.880
has been recorded. And before I realized that we had juniperi, I might have recorded some as Ceanothiella.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.760
Okay. So it's probably best. Only after I got these really. Lump them? Lump them? Yeah.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.760
It would be nice if we had the collection in front of us so you could see what they look like.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.000
Oh, my God. I forgot to say. That's something. It's always a possibility.

05:17.440 --> 05:24.400
Pyromyzen. There was a guy at the Smithsonian who did a monograph on the genus. This is the geometry.

05:24.400 --> 05:33.920
It's a big geometry. And the species are all kind of similar to one another.

05:36.160 --> 05:48.720
And as it turned out, he recognized a large number of Western species as well as a large number of

05:48.720 --> 05:58.560
ones outside of the West. And it turned out that many of these Western species

06:00.160 --> 06:04.240
had similar, if not identical, genitalia.

06:06.720 --> 06:15.120
Well, recently Wagner has done some DNA analysis. And it turns out that most of these Western species

06:15.120 --> 06:22.240
that could not be differentiated on the basis of genitalia have the same DNA fingerprints.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
So I think this may be

06:28.480 --> 06:30.880
synonymized with another species.

06:30.880 --> 06:36.080
But for the longest time, because the late flying ones look different than the early flying ones,

06:36.080 --> 06:41.360
I thought we might have two species here. You know, so I got the monograph and I looked and I was

06:41.360 --> 06:47.440
disappointed to see that the genitalia wouldn't work. So there could be regional variation, but also

06:47.440 --> 06:51.040
temporal variation. That explains the difference.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.200
It looks like it's increasing in both Davis and Cold Canyon.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.320
It could be.

07:01.280 --> 07:08.080
Wagner said something about its abundance. And no, it wasn't this. There's a noctua that looks similar.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.680
Do you think it's native?

07:10.880 --> 07:14.320
I do. Yeah. It's everywhere. And it's out in the Channel Islands.

07:14.320 --> 07:23.520
It's everywhere. Especially now that it's several species are probably one.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
I mean, it's a big genus.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.600
There's a lot of species and many in the East.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.840
And also the things that run into each other, but like...

07:35.840 --> 07:37.680
Yeah, I actually recognize the genus.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.240
Yeah.

07:38.240 --> 07:38.320
Yeah.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.880
Petrophila confusalis.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.600
I didn't know how to tell them apart for a long time.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.560
But it turned out that the genitalia...

07:54.480 --> 07:57.120
Harry Lang, who used to be on the faculty here,

07:58.400 --> 08:01.840
he worked on aquatic moths and these have aquatic larvae.

08:01.840 --> 08:14.160
So, Grace, in Cold Canyon, sorry.

08:15.520 --> 08:22.320
It's, you see, Jalicollis or Confuselius, and then you have Jalicollis separate.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.040
Yeah, actually, same thing here. So, I think they should all be bent.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.640
Yeah, they need to be bent.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.920
So, this like Euquomius, I couldn't differentiate from one another.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.720
And then after I learned how to tell them apart,

08:33.360 --> 08:39.600
and this was, I was able to confirm it once I found illustrations of the genitalia,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.440
one of which was in Harry Lang's book.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.120
Harry Lang wrote this section on

08:47.280 --> 08:51.520
aquatic moths and aquatic insects of California.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.880
And that's where, oh, you know, there it is.

08:56.880 --> 09:03.840
Then when I dissected them, the differences are subtle, but now I can tell them on external appearance.

09:06.480 --> 09:14.240
So, the fact that either or is declining is because there's fewer or none that I now

09:15.360 --> 09:20.880
describe to that. So, this is probably one that should be reconsidered, just like Euquomius,

09:20.880 --> 09:21.520
either or.

09:21.520 --> 09:26.400
Yes, fire up. Nobody's going over it. Nobody cares.

09:26.400 --> 09:35.840
So, this funeral, I didn't get, and then it's become increasingly common in recent years.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.800
And it doesn't, it's not an early or late flying one. It's right there.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.760
Yeah. So, that one's a genuine increase.

09:43.760 --> 09:49.920
Yeah, so, but, you know, before I collected it in Davis, the person who wrote the monograph

09:49.920 --> 09:58.480
that includes this genus had records of this species from Davis. So, it's not a recent arrival

09:58.480 --> 10:03.280
in Davis. It's been around, but it took a while to get to my neighborhood, I guess.

10:03.280 --> 10:08.000
Yes. And I'm not sure what it feeds like, but it might be in the monograph.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.680
You know, I think all the records in the monographs are on that

10:15.040 --> 10:20.960
database that's online that you can check. But if not, you can check the monograph.

10:20.960 --> 10:26.480
Yeah. Yeah, I did look up one of them they talked about last time.

10:26.480 --> 10:33.200
Um, Eudonia Spenceri. I said I didn't know what the host plant was. And so, I looked it up,

10:33.200 --> 10:37.120
and they didn't, they didn't know at the time that the monograph was written either. So,

10:37.120 --> 10:39.040
Oh, okay. So, no one knows.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
So, no one knows.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.280
Physiotodes musadella.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.480
Physiotodes musadella and Physiotodes alatella

10:54.480 --> 11:02.560
were kind of combined. And Physiotodes is now three species recognized in the US.

11:03.360 --> 11:08.800
And I've been calling all the Western ones musadella. But whether they all are or not,

11:08.800 --> 11:16.400
I don't know. I don't know what was used to differentiate musadella from alatella.

11:17.440 --> 11:23.600
But alatella was considered to be a European species, I think. But it's

11:24.960 --> 11:31.200
they're calling the Eastern component of what we used to call alatella or alatella,

11:31.200 --> 11:38.000
subspecies of musadella. They're calling them alatella. So, I'm not quite certain whether

11:39.680 --> 11:45.520
it's a native species or not. And I don't know how to tell it. But what I've called musadella,

11:45.520 --> 11:52.240
I probably all correct, except at Cold Canyon, where I may not have

11:52.240 --> 12:05.040
correctly differentiated it from baphyla aramiata. And I have one specimen of baphyla aramiata from

12:05.040 --> 12:15.520
my backyard confirmed by dissection. And baphyla aramiata feeds on scale insects. That's a larva.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.000
Whoa. What's the name of this thing?

12:18.000 --> 12:31.680
What's the name of this thing? Baphyla, B-A-P-H-A-L-A. Species E-R-E-M-I-A-T-A.

12:31.680 --> 12:37.360
Baphyla, B-A-L-A-A. And it's similar then to Faisatodes.

12:38.160 --> 12:44.320
Yeah. It looks like you have it declining in Davis and in Cold Canyon.

12:44.320 --> 12:56.240
It could be. I think Musadella has a wide range of known viral hosts, but I can't.

12:56.800 --> 13:05.280
This is speculation on my part. Faisatodes in general are difficult to identify.

13:05.280 --> 13:17.040
One of the new species this year is identical, almost identical to a species that I never collected,

13:17.040 --> 13:26.720
but Bill Patterson reported at Quail Ridge. And when I dissected it, it was clearly

13:27.520 --> 13:33.200
not the species that Bill Patterson reported. And, you know, I told Bill, you know,

13:33.200 --> 13:38.880
these might be misidentified. I said, you know, he donated his, so I'll look at them when I have

13:38.880 --> 13:44.160
a chance and let you know what they are. And he says, well, they look both the same to me.

13:44.880 --> 13:50.880
Bill is really good at telling things, just that external of those. But externally,

13:50.880 --> 13:55.360
the palpia are a bit longer, and there may be a size different, but when you look at picture

13:55.360 --> 14:01.360
photographs, you know, the photographs don't tell you how large they are or what the size range is.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.040
Do you think this is a native species?

14:06.640 --> 14:13.200
Hard to know. A lot of these, you know, these pantry moths and Faisatines in general,

14:13.200 --> 14:24.320
a lot of them are generalists. And so there's the potential that they could have been in any number of

14:24.320 --> 14:31.840
accidentally imported. Can you, I think we're going to have to go through and label these as

14:31.840 --> 14:38.560
native, non-native, or we don't know, just really quickly. So if you could tell me whether you think

14:38.560 --> 14:42.000
they're native or non-native as we go through. I could tell you what I think, but it might be that

14:42.000 --> 14:47.280
it's online whether they're native or not. Oh, okay. We can double check. But I care what you think, too.

14:47.280 --> 14:52.720
Because I think Wikipedia, you know, Wikipedia sometimes says. But with these micro moths,

14:53.440 --> 14:55.600
it's pretty much your opinion. Yeah. Like, that's what we got.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.520
Well, I'll tell you when I have some knowledge of it. You know, like that Inafila beef lab,

15:01.520 --> 15:07.840
a jury wrote a paper on it, you know. Even when you have a speculation, tell us. Yeah. Okay.

15:09.360 --> 15:14.000
Well, I can tell you if I think there's a high probability, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We won't

15:14.000 --> 15:19.120
misrepresent or say you said it was native when you don't know. Pigretti and Mert Valdella

15:19.120 --> 15:26.560
disappeared completely for a while. Is that the next one? Um, my phone is about to die. Oh, I got it.
