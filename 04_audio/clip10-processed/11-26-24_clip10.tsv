800	2000	Okay, starting back up.
10480	14400	On to Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.
14400	21440	This is a Blastobasin and it disappeared completely in my yard for a while and then reappeared.
21440	41120	Blastobases in general, most Blastobases seem to get into like abandoned feeding shelters of other Lepidoptera.
41120	56380	So they kind of scavenge the remains, you know, frass and just debris left behind by others.
57880	67180	And they're hard to find if you look for the larvae, but I got a number of them just by clipping branches one time
67180	71520	and bringing them into the lab, sticking it in their bag and Blastobases came out.
72340	77760	But Pigridia, Pigridiines, I think, are more prone to be specialists.
78440	83320	And this moth looks like pictures of Pigridia and Mert-Feldela.
84100	90100	And for a while, Moth Photographers Group showed its distribution to be in California,
90460	95320	then removed it, and now I think it's brought it back again.
95320	104120	So I don't know whether what I'm calling Pigridia and Mert-Feldela is that species or not.
104820	108140	So there's some doubt as to the specific identification.
108880	121500	The second thing is some of the pictures online show a form that's different than the ones that I record as Mert-Feldela.
121500	128160	And they might have been recorded in the wastebasket Blastobases.
129840	131740	So that's a problem.
131960	133760	This might not be complete.
134100	143040	If we have the all-gray form, that I wouldn't have recorded as Mert-Feldela.
143040	145180	What would you have recorded it as?
145400	146420	Do you have another one?
146640	148740	I call it Blastobases.
148740	149540	What do I call it?
150000	150480	Blastobases.
152060	153300	Unidentified Blastobases.
153820	153840	Yeah.
156200	158260	Blastobases have very fancy...
158260	161920	There is a guy who specializes them in the Smithsonian.
162140	164300	I thought about sending them specimens.
164300	167300	But then I heard that he sits on them forever.
168000	177640	At least, you know, I have the option of at least dissecting them and sorting them out by ones that have similar genitalia.
178060	181120	And I would hope to be able to associate males with females.
181520	183480	But Blastobases in general are...
183480	193720	There is a character on the antennae that can be used to separate Pigridia from the other genera of Blastobases.
194940	197640	So that might be...
197640	200620	It might not be this species, but it's definitely this genus.
200980	201220	Yeah.
201500	204400	Jerry originally told me it was Pigridia.
204860	205120	Okay.
205260	211380	But there might also be other individuals in Blastobases that are actually also this species.
211380	215080	Well, no, there may be other Pigridia that look like Mert Feldella.
215420	215780	Okay.
216560	223580	Because for some reason, they pulled the dots indicating that there were specimens.
224020	227600	It was known from California, often mouth photographers group.
227860	230480	And they may have been reinserted.
230500	231000	I don't know.
231060	232960	So can we call this Pigridia spa?
233300	236520	I call it Pigridia Mert Feldella question mark.
236520	243220	And we're using the question mark then to indicate discomfort.
245440	249880	See, it has this orange here and a fairly strong band.
250660	252820	And see, now there's no records in the West.
253060	254520	But the one we get...
254520	256520	And if you scroll down...
256520	258220	But, like, the shirts don't fit me if they're small because...
258220	258860	They don't show...
258860	259680	They don't show everything up here.
261140	262120	And I'm like, shit!
262120	262860	They don't show it anymore.
263500	266560	But the ones I get look exactly like that.
267240	267680	Aw!
268680	270000	Oh, my God, the manatees!
270360	271360	So, um...
271360	272980	The manatees are adorable.
273300	279280	It may be that this guy at the Smithsonian says, no, it doesn't occur in the West.
279280	284400	But that may be based upon he hadn't seen any specimens from the West.
284620	284900	Right.
286240	287740	I mean, you can't...
287740	290120	And people don't send them to him because he sits on them.
290660	290900	Yeah.
292280	299760	When people say this is a distribution, it's really based upon specimens I examined, reports,
299940	301180	or this, that, or the other thing.
301180	307660	And some people are very conservative and will only base it on specimens that they've examined
307660	313020	where other people base it upon multiple sources.
319020	325700	Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.
325700	327700	Platyedra sub-scenaria is an introduced species for sure.
327700	327940	And it has a back print, too.
329780	333460	And it was a...
333460	337980	I don't know that we have it at Cold Kenyon.
339200	348580	It was originally intercepted at San Francisco Airport.
348580	350080	Hmm, hmm.
350080	357820	Well, it was originally identified from a specimen that was intercepted at San Francisco Airport.
358520	362840	And it turned out that Jerry had been collecting it in his backyard in Berkeley,
362980	364700	so he was going to write a paper on it.
364760	365300	Oh, yeah.
365460	366320	I think the judge will be.
366400	367080	And then...
367080	367140	Yeah.
369620	374900	He found that both I and Greg had specimens from around here,
375000	377420	and I think Bill had one from Sacramento or something.
377720	378780	So it turned out here.
378780	383040	And then when the paper went out for review, it went to CDFA.
383460	387060	And it turned out they've been getting hundreds and hundreds of them in cotton fields.
387900	390220	And it's a minor pest of cotton.
391320	394220	And I think it's imported from the Middle East.
394220	408340	I think it feeds on Malbaceae.
408780	418220	And the abundance kind of comes and goes depending on whether I have hollyhocks in my yard that year or not.
418220	422280	So this could be artificial increase.
422480	424900	I've been tended to grow hollyhocks.
425400	428340	Once you grow hollyhocks, you can't get rid of them because they...
428340	433600	So you think that they're, like, increasing in your yard, and so you're getting more and more of them.
433600	433760	Yeah.
433760	435120	So it might not be a regional trend.
435500	440680	Well, that and other people are planting hollyhocks, too, because they're pretty drought tolerant.
441020	442020	And they're showy.
442020	454360	So, you know, we're in one of those neighborhoods where the residents have adopted landscaping that the city used to do.
455480	457140	You know, they have that adopted part.
457360	460840	I mean, we're too cheap to keep your neighborhood up anymore.
460840	465040	Yeah, exactly, because a lot of those people will say, you know, pesticides, they never talk.
465040	470040	Plotinotus stoltana is another introduced pest species.
470200	473660	I think it's called the omnivorous leaf roller or something like that.
474760	477900	So very seldom at Cove Canyon.
478120	479600	This is one of those pest species.
479920	480020	Yeah.
480840	488320	And it's found throughout the year.
488320	494620	The numbers vary from year to year, but I think this is real, that the trend is it's getting increased.
494860	497160	So it's not found in the Bay Area, for example.
498120	499040	Very common here.
499040	502660	Yeah, that's what I was wondering, because, like, the only other reason that I can think of it.
502660	505960	You put that John thinks it's increasing, even though it's not showing up.
505980	507080	He's on a lot of things.
507520	508340	I'm never asleep.
508520	510220	I think that's a common name.
510280	510840	I'm not sure.
513980	517160	Clodia interpunctella is the coddling moth.
518320	522580	And I think it's probably introduced.
523840	528080	And in my yard, it could be on my pluot tree.
529220	534160	But it gets in walnut husk and things like that, too.
534540	536480	So not at all.
536480	541300	Well, I don't know that I have any records from Cove Canyon whatsoever.
541300	543360	And then I was like, that's a lot of old fears.
543880	548140	And then I was like, what if I did, like, harvestmen?
548920	552240	Flutella xylosella is the diamondback moth.
552240	553360	There's nothing known about them.
553500	554580	It's all doing a lot of this.
554580	557200	A cosmopolitan species on...
557200	558340	Tomato?
559220	559860	Pardon me?
559860	560720	Is it tomato?
561720	562480	Solanaceae?
563260	563380	What?
563540	567200	No, it feeds on the mustard family.
567500	567780	Oh.
569120	569860	Which is surprising.
570100	570920	I don't know.
571080	572200	I saw one.
574580	577740	Would you say you think it might be declining in Davis?
577740	581800	No, I don't think it is.
582560	583560	Obrus casei.
585380	590500	It seems to enjoy outbursts and then disappear and then come back.
590500	592500	And...
592500	606800	There are other native species that look very similar to it.
606800	609680	And I've only recorded one of them.
610760	612620	And I think from my yard.
616660	626860	You know, this is a notorious moth because it was the first one to be shown to have become resistant to BT.
626860	641740	So, Grace, we shouldn't be seeing that day positives go up over time, but that we have negative trend, or that we have a negative overall trend, right?
642800	644580	Is it brass acaciae?
644680	646000	Is that what mustard's like?
646000	646060	Mm-hmm.
646060	647260	It is a cotton.
647260	652420	Isn't it day positives that we wanted on the axis, so that...
652420	655420	Yeah, but it's not fractional day positives for this graph.
655580	655940	Got it.
656120	656420	Got it.
656540	659220	So, if collection effort is changing in tandem, it might...
659220	660160	I understand.
660160	660520	Okay.
661260	665520	One of the host plants is ericimum, wallflower, and fireweed, among the other.
667060	676200	And I got a wildflower seed mixture one year, and after I took out one plant in my eye, I just threw these down.
676200	688680	And it turned out the only one that has persisted is ericimum, and it reproduces, it replaces itself each year.
688860	698420	You know, it dies back, and so it's not a perennial, it's an annual, but it reproduces quite readily from the seed production.
698420	710820	But I have a varying amount of offspring each year, so some of this is due to the existence of ericimum in my yard.
711480	725020	And it may also be subject to whether people are growing winter vegetables, you know, cabbages and other things.
725020	737160	And, you know, some of the weedy mustards are disappearing now that some of the fields are being converted to housing.
741480	743440	But nobody knows where it originated.
743820	749800	It's cosmopolitan, so anywhere where people live, you can find Plutella xylis.
749800	754900	So, you know, Linnaeus described it, so it was already in Europe, and maybe originated in Europe.
755520	765780	But some people think that it originated in the New World, because there are a number of very similar species in the New World that are not in the Old World.
767780	768660	No skipper.
768660	772100	Pryognis.
772120	772320	Pryognis.
772320	773400	Pryognitis Robinii is a...
775060	776440	Pryognis.
779820	780720	All the ground.
782080	782940	First of seed.
786440	787400	The family?
788260	789100	The family.
790980	791760	Caussidae.
791940	792480	Caussidae.
792740	793200	Yeah.
793200	797760	Casas are some kind known as goat moth and I always wondered why they were
797760	806760	called goat moth and I had a book on South African moths and the larvae are
806760	814960	kind of a pet they go into tree wounds and some of them are capable of boring
814960	827560	into healthy trees and the ex scrimma that comes out of the boreholes this it
827560	834880	was was according to one derivation of the name smells like goats has a goaty
834880	840100	odor but I don't know if that's why they're called and this is a very
840100	846700	widespread species the male is small and has smaller much smaller than the
846700	856660	female and has a horn orange hind wing whereas the female is all gray it's rare
856660	863100	to absent along coastal California for some reason and it just shows up
863100	868900	sporadically in my yard Greg had it fairly common in his yard
868900	879220	a dying cherry tree and I think that if you have wounded trees in your yard they
879220	890900	are attracted to the tree wounds so I don't know I think the numbers are too low
890900	899380	really to identify a trend but possibly
899380	909140	Procorodes Truxaliata is a geometrid that feeds on baccarus coyote bush and there was
909140	914300	when I first came here there's a guy from Australia who is investigating this for
914300	921980	a possible biocontrol of coyote bush in Australia where it is a major pest coyote
921980	932780	bush not the mall and I don't have coyote I don't have baccarus in my yard but there is some in the
932780	945100	linear park to the east of the green zone I guess they call it just one block to the east of my house you
945100	952300	know plus Davis pond is one block to the west so there's a lot of coyote bush around both
952300	961020	one both planted ones and non-planted ones so it's around and it shows up fairly regularly
963980	971660	Proxenus Mindara was identified originally by Ron Robertson who was very good on it but he
971660	982460	said I'd guess when he identified it so I at some time decided it could be one or the other and
982460	991500	possibly both and apparently there's a character in the the genitalia of one species but not the other
991500	999420	is available online so you know when the other ones is available I'll probably dissect them but I set a
999420	1007260	number aside but whether we have one species or two I don't know but every once in a while they seem to
1008140	1019660	show up in big numbers and then back down for a while this p-r-o-x it starts at Proxenus
1019660	1031180	this along with beet army worm and that carriage line in Montana which I've mentioned they're right
1031180	1038460	next to one another in the checklist and all of them seem to have population like wax and wane from
1038460	1045740	time to time spodoptera seemed yeah spodoptera was still the most common to a metro to buy yard this year
1045740	1052060	but it was down in numbers do you think that um it's native i think so
1055580	1056700	but again that's
1060220	1063260	pirellis farinalis is a
1065340	1069580	stored it's the grain moth a grain moth or something like it
1069580	1075420	farina you know farina is what some kind of boiled wheat
