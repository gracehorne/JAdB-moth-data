WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
we're at homeosoma electella yes thank you guys sorry i have to run away sure

00:08.320 --> 00:11.520
this is another sunflower boss and

00:13.760 --> 00:19.280
for some reason it's a variable species but the western ones around here are all kind of

00:19.280 --> 00:25.280
glossy looking and look different but ones that i collected early in the year

00:25.280 --> 00:34.000
look like ones from out of our area which are more uh kind of granular looking i don't know how to

00:34.000 --> 00:42.640
expect they look like sand you know desert sand or something rather than shiny and somewhat tan

00:45.600 --> 00:52.960
but it turns out there's a second species here called homeosoma oslorellum

00:52.960 --> 01:02.000
okay and in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones yeah i'll be there in about 10 minutes

01:02.720 --> 01:06.320
um in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones

01:07.760 --> 01:16.960
they turned out to be oslorellum and may have been recorded as uh electoa oh so do not trust but i

01:16.960 --> 01:25.360
save most of them so it may be possible to go back and determine whether they are oslorellum or

01:25.360 --> 01:34.080
electilla and i saved them because they did look so different than the shinier moth um that tends to

01:34.080 --> 01:38.160
fly later in the year or at least build up in numbers until later in the year

01:38.160 --> 01:44.640
so that's something that we can put on the back burner

01:47.040 --> 01:54.000
but you know in the first monograph on visa times the author of that commented that there was lots of

01:54.000 --> 02:01.360
different forms of electella but he may not have realized that there was more than one species when he

02:01.360 --> 02:10.800
he made that comment hyleus phyleus hyalephala phyleus is a skipper a butterfly it's native

02:11.520 --> 02:19.920
but it's a lawn moth so it seems to be found in urban areas on lawns

02:19.920 --> 02:32.240
uh and it turns up on light at light on hot nights as long as well as a very similar looking lawn moth

02:33.120 --> 02:41.840
that is probably native whereas this i'm less sure as native i don't know art could probably

02:41.840 --> 02:48.400
give you more information on the skippers the other one is that atalapides campestras

02:49.200 --> 02:53.120
which we may have i don't know whether you included it or not

02:55.760 --> 03:03.360
it would only be at davis i never got skippers at cold canyon at light yeah i don't think that one was

03:03.360 --> 03:03.840
included

03:03.840 --> 03:09.680
no atalapides was not in there

03:12.720 --> 03:19.440
though it may not be an atalapides anymore butterfly taxonomy is like changes all the time chasing a

03:19.440 --> 03:21.280
dragonfly you just can't catch it

03:25.360 --> 03:26.720
okay where was i

03:26.720 --> 03:31.200
the skipper ohyleus lineata

03:33.280 --> 03:41.520
that's a syngid that's the line sphinx white line sphinx yeah yeah and it migrates out of

03:41.520 --> 03:49.600
deserts particularly in drought years and when it does it shows up in a

03:49.600 --> 04:03.280
a mostly early in the year and um with a greater range of size than when it's non-migratory

04:08.560 --> 04:08.800
so

04:12.800 --> 04:16.640
greater numbers may indicate drought and desert areas

04:19.600 --> 04:24.640
i mean i've been in places in southern california where the caterpillars are like

04:25.840 --> 04:33.120
teeming all over the place everywhere you walk so it's just crazy uh and then they migrate because

04:33.120 --> 04:46.320
they in bad years or caterpillars outnumber food sources they're out of town the sinopolia olivacea

04:46.320 --> 04:54.320
um i need to confirm the identity because there's another species which i first reported last year

04:56.160 --> 05:00.640
the name of which i can't recall off the top of my head

05:04.560 --> 05:10.320
the illustrations of the genitalia are available so i would be able to confirm it

05:10.320 --> 05:18.240
but i haven't been getting this in recent years as frequently as greg has in his yard but this

05:19.200 --> 05:25.680
is one of those species that flies late and now with more late collecting nights i would have expected

05:25.680 --> 05:31.840
it to be turning up more frequently rather than less frequently so why it disappeared is

05:33.120 --> 05:37.280
due to something other than climate change i think

05:37.280 --> 05:41.840
do you know it's food plant i think it's

05:43.440 --> 05:48.960
feeds on various trees and shrubs as is the case with most of these live in sinopolia

05:49.760 --> 05:51.120
but i'd have to look that up

05:54.080 --> 05:58.320
the sinopolia quadrilineata is the most common species here in davis

05:58.320 --> 06:09.680
um extremely common in some years the mid the early season ones are larger than the late season ones

06:09.680 --> 06:14.000
which are often considerably smaller than the early season ones

06:16.160 --> 06:23.520
but i i think that's just generations of the same moth and maybe the post plant quality is

06:23.520 --> 06:27.360
and availability goes down later in the year

06:29.440 --> 06:30.240
leucania

06:31.120 --> 06:37.120
wajacana leucania is a difficult genus most of the species are very similar to one another

06:37.120 --> 06:40.720
and i've been calling this wajacana on the basis of

06:40.720 --> 06:54.480
um identification by somebody who is notorious for misidentifying moths but it does match a

06:57.760 --> 07:03.840
descriptions of the moth on a website which has recently been deleted from the internet

07:03.840 --> 07:04.400
oh no

07:07.440 --> 07:11.840
what happened was there was a specialist in the group and he tried to

07:14.800 --> 07:21.760
characterize the moth without using the genitalia as a character you know where i would have rather

07:21.760 --> 07:27.840
seen the genitalia so i could confirm what they are but but now everything's gone so

07:27.840 --> 07:35.440
lucca goniella californica and distincta is a very small gala kid and

07:38.560 --> 07:44.400
might be a scavenger or might feed on like grains and seeds and things like that

07:45.360 --> 07:50.160
it turns up in weird situation in some years is extremely common

07:50.160 --> 07:59.440
um not so common this year so i don't know what's going on with it and i cannot tell the species apart

07:59.440 --> 08:06.800
by looking at them whereas you see pictures of ones that haven't been dissected posted on the internet

08:06.800 --> 08:14.640
so i don't how can you tell i don't trust those photos of undissected moths unless you know that they were

08:14.640 --> 08:26.400
dissected um subsequently and they look like some species and other genera so this is kind of a

08:26.400 --> 08:34.240
wastebasket i did dissect a few and i think all the ones in davis were one species or the other whereas

08:34.240 --> 08:46.000
at cold canyon i found both species by up to ladies is a tiny um terra for it and

08:47.520 --> 08:54.560
its abundance seems to vary from year to year but in general there seems to be fewer than in recent

08:54.560 --> 09:02.320
years than i was getting some years ago but your data suggests that is this inclining or decline uh

09:02.320 --> 09:12.080
declining the red is declining so that's what i sensed that it's in decline and some of them are

09:13.200 --> 09:21.680
much smaller than others so it may be that host plant quality affects the size of them some moths are

09:21.680 --> 09:31.200
very consistent in size or others not so much my machinia rufofascialis is a widespread

09:31.200 --> 09:38.560
pyralid moth and it's turned up in varying amounts like you see it in the sierra

09:39.440 --> 09:43.600
much more commonly than you do here in the valley and

09:46.160 --> 09:50.560
it seemed to me that it disappeared for a while but i got a couple

09:52.320 --> 09:59.440
you know more than two or three in recent years once again disappeared completely for the most part for

09:59.440 --> 10:10.240
some time i don't know it's biology how's it going god hi grace hi how's it going cold yeah it's very

10:10.240 --> 10:19.680
cold out well we're we'll quit around 10. momphus cephalanthi aloe was um is a tiny momphid and

10:19.680 --> 10:29.520
momphids are specialists on uh evening primrose family but i just grab your stuff i don't know whether

10:29.520 --> 10:38.720
cephalanthus is in that family or not let's see i'd have to look that up but i assume that's the food plant

10:40.240 --> 10:49.680
uh it's in rubesi it's in what rubesi yeah an evening primrose family is on a gracie yeah

10:49.680 --> 10:57.280
on a gracie i think yeah yeah so this is kind of an odd one and it's considerably smaller than the

10:57.280 --> 11:05.840
other momphids half the size so and uh pal identified it you know and i asked him are you

11:05.840 --> 11:10.880
sure and he says well it looks like it and that's so it's the name he used

11:14.640 --> 11:21.760
momphid species 10 um i sent these off because i to the specialists on momphids

11:22.960 --> 11:31.600
because i thought they were momphids or elakistis i'm sorry and he sent them right back said that they're

11:31.600 --> 11:39.920
other momphids but probably in unidentified species and i think wagner reared this from

11:40.560 --> 11:53.200
grasses in his yard in berkeley but i'm not 100 sure about that but uh it's varied in abundance over the

11:53.200 --> 11:59.280
years but does seem to be in decline as your analyses suggests

12:06.640 --> 12:12.640
the nofis cross the capitella is a tinea that might be introduced

12:12.640 --> 12:23.920
and it's distinctive so this is one of the tineas that i'm certain of the identification

12:27.200 --> 12:27.520
and

12:29.920 --> 12:35.120
as your data suggests it does seem to have declined in recent years

12:35.120 --> 12:46.880
let's finish this page and then we'll call it quits so sounds good methimna unipuncta

12:48.560 --> 12:54.080
widespread species but studies studies in europe shows that there's both a

12:55.280 --> 13:02.000
non-migratory and migratory populations of it and the migratory ones show up in the fall

13:02.560 --> 13:10.160
and indeed i do get a lot of them in the fall but whether that's due to the native population

13:10.160 --> 13:14.880
building up in numbers or migration ones coming in it's got a common name

13:16.640 --> 13:26.960
yellow striped army worm or i think it's an army worm yeah and it's can be confused with lucania

13:26.960 --> 13:31.840
okay and also moss in the genus alicia but

13:36.320 --> 13:42.160
i'm fairly certain that most if not all have been correctly identified

13:46.800 --> 13:51.600
and also the same for what i've been calling lucania which could be more than one species

13:51.600 --> 13:57.360
and maybe a different one noctua pro nuvo is a recent

13:57.360 --> 14:06.080
um invader invasive species and greg got one in his yard was the first one in davis a year before

14:06.640 --> 14:12.560
i got it in my yard and it seemed to be increasing in abundance and now reaching more

14:12.560 --> 14:20.800
more consistent numbers and it's prolificus um was introduced from europe and was making

14:21.600 --> 14:27.360
almost predictable progress from the east coast where it first showed up across the u.s and then

14:27.360 --> 14:39.200
suddenly jumped into california around 2000 2002 or so so it's a an invasive species that we detected

14:39.200 --> 14:40.400
during this survey

14:43.280 --> 14:44.880
nomophila neartica

14:47.360 --> 14:54.880
was in pretty good numbers at the beginning of my survey then dropped off and then showed up again

14:54.880 --> 14:58.480
from time from time to time feeds on low growing plants so it may be

15:01.280 --> 15:02.720
maybe one that

15:05.120 --> 15:13.680
abundance is related to rainfall so you know that's something you might look for if there's a correlation

15:13.680 --> 15:13.840
there

15:17.360 --> 15:22.080
and it does have a light long flight season

15:25.120 --> 15:30.080
i think this year was a reasonably you know slightly more than average but

15:31.600 --> 15:37.360
it's hard to know you know unless you index it for the frequency of collecting which i think your

15:37.360 --> 15:45.040
program does yeah yeah these are just raw counts but yeah but you know also because it has a long flight

15:45.040 --> 15:51.920
season you get the extremes are going to be out there but most of them fly mid-year

15:51.920 --> 15:58.320
a label on the box awesome thank you so much that was okay we're making progress we're making progress

15:58.320 --> 15:58.640
good
