0	5600	we're at homeosoma electella yes thank you guys sorry i have to run away sure
8320	11520	this is another sunflower boss and
13760	19280	for some reason it's a variable species but the western ones around here are all kind of
19280	25280	glossy looking and look different but ones that i collected early in the year
25280	34000	look like ones from out of our area which are more uh kind of granular looking i don't know how to
34000	42640	expect they look like sand you know desert sand or something rather than shiny and somewhat tan
45600	52960	but it turns out there's a second species here called homeosoma oslorellum
52960	62000	okay and in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones yeah i'll be there in about 10 minutes
62720	66320	um in dissecting most many of those earlier gray ones
67760	76960	they turned out to be oslorellum and may have been recorded as uh electoa oh so do not trust but i
76960	85360	save most of them so it may be possible to go back and determine whether they are oslorellum or
85360	94080	electilla and i saved them because they did look so different than the shinier moth um that tends to
94080	98160	fly later in the year or at least build up in numbers until later in the year
98160	104640	so that's something that we can put on the back burner
107040	114000	but you know in the first monograph on visa times the author of that commented that there was lots of
114000	121360	different forms of electella but he may not have realized that there was more than one species when he
121360	130800	he made that comment hyleus phyleus hyalephala phyleus is a skipper a butterfly it's native
131520	139920	but it's a lawn moth so it seems to be found in urban areas on lawns
139920	152240	uh and it turns up on light at light on hot nights as long as well as a very similar looking lawn moth
153120	161840	that is probably native whereas this i'm less sure as native i don't know art could probably
161840	168400	give you more information on the skippers the other one is that atalapides campestras
169200	173120	which we may have i don't know whether you included it or not
175760	183360	it would only be at davis i never got skippers at cold canyon at light yeah i don't think that one was
183360	183840	included
183840	189680	no atalapides was not in there
192720	199440	though it may not be an atalapides anymore butterfly taxonomy is like changes all the time chasing a
199440	201280	dragonfly you just can't catch it
205360	206720	okay where was i
206720	211200	the skipper ohyleus lineata
213280	221520	that's a syngid that's the line sphinx white line sphinx yeah yeah and it migrates out of
221520	229600	deserts particularly in drought years and when it does it shows up in a
229600	243280	a mostly early in the year and um with a greater range of size than when it's non-migratory
248560	248800	so
252800	256640	greater numbers may indicate drought and desert areas
259600	264640	i mean i've been in places in southern california where the caterpillars are like
265840	273120	teeming all over the place everywhere you walk so it's just crazy uh and then they migrate because
273120	286320	they in bad years or caterpillars outnumber food sources they're out of town the sinopolia olivacea
286320	294320	um i need to confirm the identity because there's another species which i first reported last year
296160	300640	the name of which i can't recall off the top of my head
304560	310320	the illustrations of the genitalia are available so i would be able to confirm it
310320	318240	but i haven't been getting this in recent years as frequently as greg has in his yard but this
319200	325680	is one of those species that flies late and now with more late collecting nights i would have expected
325680	331840	it to be turning up more frequently rather than less frequently so why it disappeared is
333120	337280	due to something other than climate change i think
337280	341840	do you know it's food plant i think it's
343440	348960	feeds on various trees and shrubs as is the case with most of these live in sinopolia
349760	351120	but i'd have to look that up
354080	358320	the sinopolia quadrilineata is the most common species here in davis
358320	369680	um extremely common in some years the mid the early season ones are larger than the late season ones
369680	374000	which are often considerably smaller than the early season ones
376160	383520	but i i think that's just generations of the same moth and maybe the post plant quality is
383520	387360	and availability goes down later in the year
389440	390240	leucania
391120	397120	wajacana leucania is a difficult genus most of the species are very similar to one another
397120	400720	and i've been calling this wajacana on the basis of
400720	414480	um identification by somebody who is notorious for misidentifying moths but it does match a
417760	423840	descriptions of the moth on a website which has recently been deleted from the internet
423840	424400	oh no
427440	431840	what happened was there was a specialist in the group and he tried to
434800	441760	characterize the moth without using the genitalia as a character you know where i would have rather
441760	447840	seen the genitalia so i could confirm what they are but but now everything's gone so
447840	455440	lucca goniella californica and distincta is a very small gala kid and
458560	464400	might be a scavenger or might feed on like grains and seeds and things like that
465360	470160	it turns up in weird situation in some years is extremely common
470160	479440	um not so common this year so i don't know what's going on with it and i cannot tell the species apart
479440	486800	by looking at them whereas you see pictures of ones that haven't been dissected posted on the internet
486800	494640	so i don't how can you tell i don't trust those photos of undissected moths unless you know that they were
494640	506400	dissected um subsequently and they look like some species and other genera so this is kind of a
506400	514240	wastebasket i did dissect a few and i think all the ones in davis were one species or the other whereas
514240	526000	at cold canyon i found both species by up to ladies is a tiny um terra for it and
527520	534560	its abundance seems to vary from year to year but in general there seems to be fewer than in recent
534560	542320	years than i was getting some years ago but your data suggests that is this inclining or decline uh
542320	552080	declining the red is declining so that's what i sensed that it's in decline and some of them are
553200	561680	much smaller than others so it may be that host plant quality affects the size of them some moths are
561680	571200	very consistent in size or others not so much my machinia rufofascialis is a widespread
571200	578560	pyralid moth and it's turned up in varying amounts like you see it in the sierra
579440	583600	much more commonly than you do here in the valley and
586160	590560	it seemed to me that it disappeared for a while but i got a couple
592320	599440	you know more than two or three in recent years once again disappeared completely for the most part for
599440	610240	some time i don't know it's biology how's it going god hi grace hi how's it going cold yeah it's very
610240	619680	cold out well we're we'll quit around 10. momphus cephalanthi aloe was um is a tiny momphid and
619680	629520	momphids are specialists on uh evening primrose family but i just grab your stuff i don't know whether
629520	638720	cephalanthus is in that family or not let's see i'd have to look that up but i assume that's the food plant
640240	649680	uh it's in rubesi it's in what rubesi yeah an evening primrose family is on a gracie yeah
649680	657280	on a gracie i think yeah yeah so this is kind of an odd one and it's considerably smaller than the
657280	665840	other momphids half the size so and uh pal identified it you know and i asked him are you
665840	670880	sure and he says well it looks like it and that's so it's the name he used
674640	681760	momphid species 10 um i sent these off because i to the specialists on momphids
682960	691600	because i thought they were momphids or elakistis i'm sorry and he sent them right back said that they're
691600	699920	other momphids but probably in unidentified species and i think wagner reared this from
700560	713200	grasses in his yard in berkeley but i'm not 100 sure about that but uh it's varied in abundance over the
713200	719280	years but does seem to be in decline as your analyses suggests
726640	732640	the nofis cross the capitella is a tinea that might be introduced
732640	743920	and it's distinctive so this is one of the tineas that i'm certain of the identification
747200	747520	and
749920	755120	as your data suggests it does seem to have declined in recent years
755120	766880	let's finish this page and then we'll call it quits so sounds good methimna unipuncta
768560	774080	widespread species but studies studies in europe shows that there's both a
775280	782000	non-migratory and migratory populations of it and the migratory ones show up in the fall
782560	790160	and indeed i do get a lot of them in the fall but whether that's due to the native population
790160	794880	building up in numbers or migration ones coming in it's got a common name
796640	806960	yellow striped army worm or i think it's an army worm yeah and it's can be confused with lucania
806960	811840	okay and also moss in the genus alicia but
816320	822160	i'm fairly certain that most if not all have been correctly identified
826800	831600	and also the same for what i've been calling lucania which could be more than one species
831600	837360	and maybe a different one noctua pro nuvo is a recent
837360	846080	um invader invasive species and greg got one in his yard was the first one in davis a year before
846640	852560	i got it in my yard and it seemed to be increasing in abundance and now reaching more
852560	860800	more consistent numbers and it's prolificus um was introduced from europe and was making
861600	867360	almost predictable progress from the east coast where it first showed up across the u.s and then
867360	879200	suddenly jumped into california around 2000 2002 or so so it's a an invasive species that we detected
879200	880400	during this survey
883280	884880	nomophila neartica
887360	894880	was in pretty good numbers at the beginning of my survey then dropped off and then showed up again
894880	898480	from time from time to time feeds on low growing plants so it may be
901280	902720	maybe one that
905120	913680	abundance is related to rainfall so you know that's something you might look for if there's a correlation
913680	913840	there
917360	922080	and it does have a light long flight season
925120	930080	i think this year was a reasonably you know slightly more than average but
931600	937360	it's hard to know you know unless you index it for the frequency of collecting which i think your
937360	945040	program does yeah yeah these are just raw counts but yeah but you know also because it has a long flight
945040	951920	season you get the extremes are going to be out there but most of them fly mid-year
951920	958320	a label on the box awesome thank you so much that was okay we're making progress we're making progress
958320	958640	good
