1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,220
I'm just going to keep recording here.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, yeah, so maybe we can go through a little bit faster, even though...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Okay, Acontea coccolettia, I think all the...

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,640
This is a very distinctive moth.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,500
All the records are here, and they're all correctly recorded.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,940
And I think it feeds on something in the Malvesi family, but I'm not sure.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,020
Wagner told me, and I promptly forgot.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,760
But if you want to know Wagner, Wagner suspects what the food plant is.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,480
May, no, I don't know.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,900
You're taking notes, right?

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,400
So I don't need to do that, okay.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,180
Acrobasis tricholorella at Cold Canyon seems to be mainly on Toyon,

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,180
but I don't have Toyon in my neighborhood.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,760
But it's somewhat common throughout the years,

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,620
and more common some years than others.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,460
I don't know what it's feeding on my yard.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,300
I have a birch tree, and I think maybe that,

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,900
but Toyon's in the Rosaceae family,

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,800
so it could be something in the Rosaceae family.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,500
I don't know enough about its life history,

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,580
but you could probably look it up.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,580
There is a Mona fascicle that includes this,

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,780
so it would be there, in which case it's probably also online.

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,260
Adelphagrotus indeterminata,

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,040
I think some of the early specimens

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,560
were erroneously recorded as Per-Abogrotus.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,340
Per-Abogrotus formalis and Adelphagrotus indeterminata

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,920
both have a black collar.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,360
The pronotum is black.

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,780
So early years are suspect.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,600
Okay.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,680
But once I started recording them as separate species,

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
the Abogrotus were all lumped together

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,600
because it got, we were calling it one thing,

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,240
and it got split into several species.

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,100
And once I learned how to,

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,580
then they started to be identified correctly.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,060
And about the same time,

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,220
I recognized indeterminata as separate from Per-Abogrotus.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,420
So the early years are suspect.

41
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,700
All the records are late in the year for Adelphagrotus.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,180
So any early records are wrong.

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,680
Aglasa caprealis is a pantry moth.

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,160
So it's sometimes a pest of stored products.

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
And I think it's the only species we have here in Davis,

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,240
but there is another Aglasa that looks very much like it.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,900
So potentially it's two species,

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
but I think it's all one.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,340
It looks like it dropped off at the end here.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Like someone treated their pantry moths or something?

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,820
I can't say,

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,640
except maybe it's because I've been better

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,800
about sweeping up my patio

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
over which I hang my sheet.

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,680
Got it.

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,360
Okay.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Pantry moths don't tend to be collected outdoors as much.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, we might want to strike that one

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,380
just from the record,

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,900
like just strike it out of the data set

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,460
because it's not an outdoor dwelling moth.

62
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

63
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,540
But we get an Aglasa at Cold Canyon,

64
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,160
which is somewhat similar,

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,000
but I don't think it's the same moth.

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,560
Okay.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,880
Agryphala anseps flies only late in the year

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,600
and it feeds on native grasses, I believe.

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,900
I think it's a sod moth.

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,500
And I haven't seen it the last couple of years.

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,780
But Greg's been reporting it from East Davis,

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
although this year he only reported

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,300
one of the other Agryphala attenuatus.

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,780
Same life history for attenuatus.

75
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,640
And it's disappeared the last couple of years too.

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,540
And that may be due to

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,280
some of what the city's doing,

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,780
you know, and landscaping and so forth,

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,340
plus developing to the north.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,360
I have no idea.

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,240
All speculation.

82
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,380
Agryphala is a black cutworm

83
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,060
pest species.

84
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,660
I think it's fairly,

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,240
I get it every year and throughout the year,

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
but the numbers vary.

87
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,300
So I think this is pretty good representation.

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,540
Amiolois transitella,

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,000
you know,

90
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,720
this is the one where I've been recording some

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,640
as ore species in here.

92
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,560
And this year I got some that are

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
pretty much intermediate.

94
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,360
So I think they're all

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,340
A. transitella.

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
So if you include those in the data,

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,220
maybe it will change the pattern.

98
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,200
But this year it was so common

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,060
that I think it's,

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
that this is real.

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,500
It is becoming more abundant

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,440
and more frequent.

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,540
And I get records

104
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,940
throughout the year.

105
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,720
This is a pest species,

106
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,600
but not a major pest species.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
It's an orchard crop species.

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,040
So maybe,

109
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,420
you know,

110
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,440
this year I had a good crop of pluots.

111
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,540
So maybe it fed on my pluots.

112
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,160
I don't know.

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,720
Hmm.

114
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Inarcia lineatella.

115
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,080
Okay.

116
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,860
Oh, okay.

117
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,640
This is a

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
Delicaea

119
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,460
that's called the

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,780
I think it feeds in

121
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,600
that it's fruit tree,

122
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,960
tips of fruit trees

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,200
or something like that.

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,600
So

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,980
I get a few every year.

126
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,140
I can't say whether it's

127
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,920
more common or less common.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
This year I didn't get very many

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:30,960
and

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,080
some years I got more

131
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
in the past.

132
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,900
Anna vitrinella

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,280
ocularia

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,900
and or

135
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,020
Pampanaria.

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,100
We

137
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,580
can't agree

138
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,400
on what species

139
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,100
we have

140
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,700
and

141
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
in Powell's

142
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,560
book

143
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,500
Oppler wrote

144
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,720
if you're not sure

145
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,900
you need to dissect them.

146
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,180
Well,

147
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,100
I could dissect them

148
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,360
but I don't

149
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
have any illustrations

150
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,740
of his genitalia

151
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,800
so I haven't bought it.

152
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,680
I remember you talking

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,360
about that one last time.

154
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,140
But I think

155
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,400
Pampanaria

156
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,460
is smaller.

157
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,940
But again,

158
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,680
this is one

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,740
where there's overlap

160
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,460
in the size

161
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,580
so I can't be sure.

162
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,140
So

163
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,020
we have that

164
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,060
uncertainty reflected

165
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,580
in the name

166
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,940
which is good.

167
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:17,960
Well,

168
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,460
I called them

169
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,080
Pampanaria

170
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,200
when I first started

171
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,020
collecting them

172
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,560
and then later

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,860
I started calling them

174
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,760
ocularia

175
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
and now

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
I've been calling

177
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
them and or

178
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,740
because I'm just

179
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,360
not sure.

180
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,200
Do you think

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,280
that this

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,260
do you think

183
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,460
in the early years

184
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,240
you just weren't

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,860
clocking them?

186
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,520
No, I didn't get

187
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,160
any in the

188
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,580
I didn't record

189
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,340
any in the

190
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,300
earlier years

191
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,140
but I don't know

192
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,860
if they were

193
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,980
a recent arrival

194
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,520
or

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,700
I just was collecting

196
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,940
I think it's one

197
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,580
that gets

198
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,340
no, I can

199
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,560
I do remember

200
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,520
that when I got it

201
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,100
I said, oh

202
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,680
I know that

203
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,500
from Cold Canyon

204
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,520
and I'd never seen

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
it in my yard before

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
so I didn't get it

207
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
in the early years

208
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
but I didn't collect

209
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,280
too frequently

210
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,420
in the early years.

211
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,320
And this is I think

212
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,140
one of those cases
