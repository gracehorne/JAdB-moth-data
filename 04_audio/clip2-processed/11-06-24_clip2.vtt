00:00.880 --> 00:03.220
I'm just going to keep recording here.

00:03.560 --> 00:08.000
Okay, yeah, so maybe we can go through a little bit faster, even though...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.320
Okay, Acontea coccolettia, I think all the...

00:10.320 --> 00:12.640
This is a very distinctive moth.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.500
All the records are here, and they're all correctly recorded.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.940
And I think it feeds on something in the Malvesi family, but I'm not sure.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.020
Wagner told me, and I promptly forgot.

00:26.020 --> 00:31.760
But if you want to know Wagner, Wagner suspects what the food plant is.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.480
May, no, I don't know.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.900
You're taking notes, right?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.400
So I don't need to do that, okay.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.180
Acrobasis tricholorella at Cold Canyon seems to be mainly on Toyon,

00:43.300 --> 00:45.180
but I don't have Toyon in my neighborhood.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.760
But it's somewhat common throughout the years,

00:51.020 --> 00:53.620
and more common some years than others.

00:56.020 --> 00:58.460
I don't know what it's feeding on my yard.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.300
I have a birch tree, and I think maybe that,

01:01.500 --> 01:03.900
but Toyon's in the Rosaceae family,

01:04.100 --> 01:06.800
so it could be something in the Rosaceae family.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.500
I don't know enough about its life history,

01:09.700 --> 01:11.580
but you could probably look it up.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.580
There is a Mona fascicle that includes this,

01:14.700 --> 01:19.780
so it would be there, in which case it's probably also online.

01:19.780 --> 01:24.260
Adelphagrotus indeterminata,

01:24.380 --> 01:27.040
I think some of the early specimens

01:27.040 --> 01:32.560
were erroneously recorded as Per-Abogrotus.

01:36.560 --> 01:44.340
Per-Abogrotus formalis and Adelphagrotus indeterminata

01:44.340 --> 01:46.920
both have a black collar.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.360
The pronotum is black.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.780
So early years are suspect.

01:57.320 --> 01:57.600
Okay.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.680
But once I started recording them as separate species,

02:02.680 --> 02:05.120
the Abogrotus were all lumped together

02:05.120 --> 02:08.600
because it got, we were calling it one thing,

02:08.680 --> 02:11.240
and it got split into several species.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.100
And once I learned how to,

02:14.380 --> 02:16.580
then they started to be identified correctly.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.060
And about the same time,

02:18.120 --> 02:22.220
I recognized indeterminata as separate from Per-Abogrotus.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.420
So the early years are suspect.

02:25.420 --> 02:30.700
All the records are late in the year for Adelphagrotus.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.180
So any early records are wrong.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.680
Aglasa caprealis is a pantry moth.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.160
So it's sometimes a pest of stored products.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.700
And I think it's the only species we have here in Davis,

02:45.940 --> 02:50.240
but there is another Aglasa that looks very much like it.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.900
So potentially it's two species,

02:54.120 --> 02:55.400
but I think it's all one.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.340
It looks like it dropped off at the end here.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.000
Like someone treated their pantry moths or something?

03:03.140 --> 03:03.820
I can't say,

03:03.980 --> 03:07.640
except maybe it's because I've been better

03:07.640 --> 03:10.800
about sweeping up my patio

03:10.800 --> 03:12.840
over which I hang my sheet.

03:13.180 --> 03:13.680
Got it.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.360
Okay.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.160
Pantry moths don't tend to be collected outdoors as much.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.640
Yeah, we might want to strike that one

03:26.640 --> 03:27.380
just from the record,

03:27.520 --> 03:29.900
like just strike it out of the data set

03:29.900 --> 03:31.460
because it's not an outdoor dwelling moth.

03:31.780 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.540
But we get an Aglasa at Cold Canyon,

03:34.940 --> 03:37.160
which is somewhat similar,

03:37.300 --> 03:39.000
but I don't think it's the same moth.

03:39.240 --> 03:39.560
Okay.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.880
Agryphala anseps flies only late in the year

03:47.880 --> 03:52.600
and it feeds on native grasses, I believe.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.900
I think it's a sod moth.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.500
And I haven't seen it the last couple of years.

04:00.160 --> 04:04.780
But Greg's been reporting it from East Davis,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.800
although this year he only reported

04:06.800 --> 04:10.300
one of the other Agryphala attenuatus.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.780
Same life history for attenuatus.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.640
And it's disappeared the last couple of years too.

04:15.640 --> 04:19.540
And that may be due to

04:19.540 --> 04:23.280
some of what the city's doing,

04:23.440 --> 04:26.780
you know, and landscaping and so forth,

04:26.900 --> 04:30.340
plus developing to the north.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.360
I have no idea.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.240
All speculation.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.380
Agryphala is a black cutworm

04:36.380 --> 04:39.060
pest species.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.660
I think it's fairly,

04:46.220 --> 04:49.240
I get it every year and throughout the year,

04:49.500 --> 04:51.100
but the numbers vary.

04:51.100 --> 04:56.300
So I think this is pretty good representation.

04:56.300 --> 05:01.540
Amiolois transitella,

05:01.760 --> 05:02.000
you know,

05:02.340 --> 05:04.720
this is the one where I've been recording some

05:04.720 --> 05:06.640
as ore species in here.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.560
And this year I got some that are

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
pretty much intermediate.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.360
So I think they're all

05:13.360 --> 05:15.340
A. transitella.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.600
So if you include those in the data,

05:18.600 --> 05:24.220
maybe it will change the pattern.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.200
But this year it was so common

05:26.200 --> 05:27.060
that I think it's,

05:27.240 --> 05:28.440
that this is real.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.500
It is becoming more abundant

05:30.500 --> 05:31.440
and more frequent.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.540
And I get records

05:34.540 --> 05:36.940
throughout the year.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.720
This is a pest species,

05:41.940 --> 05:43.600
but not a major pest species.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.700
It's an orchard crop species.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.040
So maybe,

05:49.200 --> 05:49.420
you know,

05:49.460 --> 05:51.440
this year I had a good crop of pluots.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.540
So maybe it fed on my pluots.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.160
I don't know.

05:54.160 --> 05:54.720
Hmm.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.640
Inarcia lineatella.

06:00.940 --> 06:01.080
Okay.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.860
Oh, okay.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.640
This is a

06:08.640 --> 06:10.040
Delicaea

06:10.040 --> 06:11.460
that's called the

06:11.460 --> 06:15.780
I think it feeds in

06:15.780 --> 06:17.600
that it's fruit tree,

06:17.860 --> 06:18.960
tips of fruit trees

06:18.960 --> 06:20.200
or something like that.

06:20.420 --> 06:20.600
So

06:20.600 --> 06:23.980
I get a few every year.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.140
I can't say whether it's

06:27.140 --> 06:28.920
more common or less common.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.640
This year I didn't get very many

06:30.640 --> 06:30.960
and

06:30.960 --> 06:33.080
some years I got more

06:33.080 --> 06:33.760
in the past.

06:38.760 --> 06:39.900
Anna vitrinella

06:39.900 --> 06:41.280
ocularia

06:41.280 --> 06:41.900
and or

06:41.900 --> 06:43.020
Pampanaria.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.100
We

06:45.100 --> 06:46.580
can't agree

06:46.580 --> 06:47.400
on what species

06:47.400 --> 06:48.100
we have

06:48.100 --> 06:48.700
and

06:48.700 --> 06:50.500
in Powell's

06:50.500 --> 06:51.560
book

06:51.560 --> 06:52.500
Oppler wrote

06:52.500 --> 06:53.720
if you're not sure

06:53.720 --> 06:54.900
you need to dissect them.

06:55.040 --> 06:55.180
Well,

06:55.220 --> 06:56.100
I could dissect them

06:56.100 --> 06:57.360
but I don't

06:57.360 --> 06:58.680
have any illustrations

06:58.680 --> 06:59.740
of his genitalia

06:59.740 --> 07:00.800
so I haven't bought it.

07:00.980 --> 07:01.680
I remember you talking

07:01.680 --> 07:02.360
about that one last time.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.140
But I think

07:03.140 --> 07:06.400
Pampanaria

07:06.400 --> 07:07.460
is smaller.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.940
But again,

07:09.040 --> 07:09.680
this is one

07:09.680 --> 07:10.740
where there's overlap

07:10.740 --> 07:11.460
in the size

07:11.460 --> 07:12.580
so I can't be sure.

07:13.580 --> 07:14.140
So

07:14.140 --> 07:16.020
we have that

07:16.020 --> 07:17.060
uncertainty reflected

07:17.060 --> 07:17.580
in the name

07:17.580 --> 07:17.940
which is good.

07:17.940 --> 07:17.960
Well,

07:17.960 --> 07:18.460
I called them

07:18.460 --> 07:19.080
Pampanaria

07:19.080 --> 07:20.200
when I first started

07:20.200 --> 07:21.020
collecting them

07:21.020 --> 07:22.560
and then later

07:22.560 --> 07:23.860
I started calling them

07:23.860 --> 07:24.760
ocularia

07:24.760 --> 07:25.560
and now

07:25.560 --> 07:26.480
I've been calling

07:26.480 --> 07:27.240
them and or

07:27.240 --> 07:28.740
because I'm just

07:28.740 --> 07:29.360
not sure.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.200
Do you think

07:30.200 --> 07:31.280
that this

07:31.280 --> 07:32.260
do you think

07:32.260 --> 07:33.460
in the early years

07:33.460 --> 07:34.240
you just weren't

07:34.240 --> 07:34.860
clocking them?

07:35.060 --> 07:35.520
No, I didn't get

07:35.520 --> 07:36.160
any in the

07:36.160 --> 07:37.580
I didn't record

07:37.580 --> 07:38.340
any in the

07:38.340 --> 07:39.300
earlier years

07:39.300 --> 07:40.140
but I don't know

07:40.140 --> 07:41.860
if they were

07:41.860 --> 07:42.980
a recent arrival

07:42.980 --> 07:43.520
or

07:43.520 --> 07:45.700
I just was collecting

07:45.700 --> 07:46.940
I think it's one

07:46.940 --> 07:47.580
that gets

07:47.580 --> 07:52.340
no, I can

07:52.340 --> 07:53.560
I do remember

07:53.560 --> 07:54.520
that when I got it

07:54.520 --> 07:55.100
I said, oh

07:55.100 --> 07:55.680
I know that

07:55.680 --> 07:56.500
from Cold Canyon

07:56.500 --> 07:57.520
and I'd never seen

07:57.520 --> 07:58.560
it in my yard before

07:58.560 --> 07:59.840
so I didn't get it

07:59.840 --> 08:00.640
in the early years

08:00.640 --> 08:01.600
but I didn't collect

08:01.600 --> 08:02.280
too frequently

08:02.280 --> 08:03.420
in the early years.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.320
And this is I think

08:06.320 --> 08:07.140
one of those cases
