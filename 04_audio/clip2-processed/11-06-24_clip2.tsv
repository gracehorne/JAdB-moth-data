880	3220	I'm just going to keep recording here.
3560	8000	Okay, yeah, so maybe we can go through a little bit faster, even though...
8000	10320	Okay, Acontea coccolettia, I think all the...
10320	12640	This is a very distinctive moth.
12800	17500	All the records are here, and they're all correctly recorded.
18000	23940	And I think it feeds on something in the Malvesi family, but I'm not sure.
24080	26020	Wagner told me, and I promptly forgot.
26020	31760	But if you want to know Wagner, Wagner suspects what the food plant is.
32120	33480	May, no, I don't know.
34160	35900	You're taking notes, right?
36040	37400	So I don't need to do that, okay.
38240	43180	Acrobasis tricholorella at Cold Canyon seems to be mainly on Toyon,
43300	45180	but I don't have Toyon in my neighborhood.
46640	50760	But it's somewhat common throughout the years,
51020	53620	and more common some years than others.
56020	58460	I don't know what it's feeding on my yard.
58700	61300	I have a birch tree, and I think maybe that,
61500	63900	but Toyon's in the Rosaceae family,
64100	66800	so it could be something in the Rosaceae family.
66960	69500	I don't know enough about its life history,
69700	71580	but you could probably look it up.
71680	74580	There is a Mona fascicle that includes this,
74700	79780	so it would be there, in which case it's probably also online.
79780	84260	Adelphagrotus indeterminata,
84380	87040	I think some of the early specimens
87040	92560	were erroneously recorded as Per-Abogrotus.
96560	104340	Per-Abogrotus formalis and Adelphagrotus indeterminata
104340	106920	both have a black collar.
107820	109360	The pronotum is black.
113160	116780	So early years are suspect.
117320	117600	Okay.
117820	122680	But once I started recording them as separate species,
122680	125120	the Abogrotus were all lumped together
125120	128600	because it got, we were calling it one thing,
128680	131240	and it got split into several species.
132540	134100	And once I learned how to,
134380	136580	then they started to be identified correctly.
136880	138060	And about the same time,
138120	142220	I recognized indeterminata as separate from Per-Abogrotus.
143520	145420	So the early years are suspect.
145420	150700	All the records are late in the year for Adelphagrotus.
151020	153180	So any early records are wrong.
155920	159680	Aglasa caprealis is a pantry moth.
159900	162160	So it's sometimes a pest of stored products.
162700	165700	And I think it's the only species we have here in Davis,
165940	170240	but there is another Aglasa that looks very much like it.
170240	173900	So potentially it's two species,
174120	175400	but I think it's all one.
176000	178340	It looks like it dropped off at the end here.
180120	183000	Like someone treated their pantry moths or something?
183140	183820	I can't say,
183980	187640	except maybe it's because I've been better
187640	190800	about sweeping up my patio
190800	192840	over which I hang my sheet.
193180	193680	Got it.
196680	197360	Okay.
200240	205160	Pantry moths don't tend to be collected outdoors as much.
205400	206640	Yeah, we might want to strike that one
206640	207380	just from the record,
207520	209900	like just strike it out of the data set
209900	211460	because it's not an outdoor dwelling moth.
211780	212000	Okay.
212260	214540	But we get an Aglasa at Cold Canyon,
214940	217160	which is somewhat similar,
217300	219000	but I don't think it's the same moth.
219240	219560	Okay.
224560	227880	Agryphala anseps flies only late in the year
227880	232600	and it feeds on native grasses, I believe.
233540	234900	I think it's a sod moth.
235600	238500	And I haven't seen it the last couple of years.
240160	244780	But Greg's been reporting it from East Davis,
245000	246800	although this year he only reported
246800	250300	one of the other Agryphala attenuatus.
250520	252780	Same life history for attenuatus.
252780	255640	And it's disappeared the last couple of years too.
255640	259540	And that may be due to
259540	263280	some of what the city's doing,
263440	266780	you know, and landscaping and so forth,
266900	270340	plus developing to the north.
270440	271360	I have no idea.
271460	272240	All speculation.
273720	276380	Agryphala is a black cutworm
276380	279060	pest species.
283060	285660	I think it's fairly,
286220	289240	I get it every year and throughout the year,
289500	291100	but the numbers vary.
291100	296300	So I think this is pretty good representation.
296300	301540	Amiolois transitella,
301760	302000	you know,
302340	304720	this is the one where I've been recording some
304720	306640	as ore species in here.
307580	309560	And this year I got some that are
309560	311560	pretty much intermediate.
311560	313360	So I think they're all
313360	315340	A. transitella.
316200	318600	So if you include those in the data,
318600	324220	maybe it will change the pattern.
324420	326200	But this year it was so common
326200	327060	that I think it's,
327240	328440	that this is real.
328580	330500	It is becoming more abundant
330500	331440	and more frequent.
333040	334540	And I get records
334540	336940	throughout the year.
338700	341720	This is a pest species,
341940	343600	but not a major pest species.
343600	345700	It's an orchard crop species.
348260	349040	So maybe,
349200	349420	you know,
349460	351440	this year I had a good crop of pluots.
351580	353540	So maybe it fed on my pluots.
353620	354160	I don't know.
354160	354720	Hmm.
359120	360640	Inarcia lineatella.
360940	361080	Okay.
365980	366860	Oh, okay.
366980	368640	This is a
368640	370040	Delicaea
370040	371460	that's called the
371460	375780	I think it feeds in
375780	377600	that it's fruit tree,
377860	378960	tips of fruit trees
378960	380200	or something like that.
380420	380600	So
380600	383980	I get a few every year.
385400	387140	I can't say whether it's
387140	388920	more common or less common.
389120	390640	This year I didn't get very many
390640	390960	and
390960	393080	some years I got more
393080	393760	in the past.
398760	399900	Anna vitrinella
399900	401280	ocularia
401280	401900	and or
401900	403020	Pampanaria.
404620	405100	We
405100	406580	can't agree
406580	407400	on what species
407400	408100	we have
408100	408700	and
408700	410500	in Powell's
410500	411560	book
411560	412500	Oppler wrote
412500	413720	if you're not sure
413720	414900	you need to dissect them.
415040	415180	Well,
415220	416100	I could dissect them
416100	417360	but I don't
417360	418680	have any illustrations
418680	419740	of his genitalia
419740	420800	so I haven't bought it.
420980	421680	I remember you talking
421680	422360	about that one last time.
422360	423140	But I think
423140	426400	Pampanaria
426400	427460	is smaller.
427460	428940	But again,
429040	429680	this is one
429680	430740	where there's overlap
430740	431460	in the size
431460	432580	so I can't be sure.
433580	434140	So
434140	436020	we have that
436020	437060	uncertainty reflected
437060	437580	in the name
437580	437940	which is good.
437940	437960	Well,
437960	438460	I called them
438460	439080	Pampanaria
439080	440200	when I first started
440200	441020	collecting them
441020	442560	and then later
442560	443860	I started calling them
443860	444760	ocularia
444760	445560	and now
445560	446480	I've been calling
446480	447240	them and or
447240	448740	because I'm just
448740	449360	not sure.
449780	450200	Do you think
450200	451280	that this
451280	452260	do you think
452260	453460	in the early years
453460	454240	you just weren't
454240	454860	clocking them?
455060	455520	No, I didn't get
455520	456160	any in the
456160	457580	I didn't record
457580	458340	any in the
458340	459300	earlier years
459300	460140	but I don't know
460140	461860	if they were
461860	462980	a recent arrival
462980	463520	or
463520	465700	I just was collecting
465700	466940	I think it's one
466940	467580	that gets
467580	472340	no, I can
472340	473560	I do remember
473560	474520	that when I got it
474520	475100	I said, oh
475100	475680	I know that
475680	476500	from Cold Canyon
476500	477520	and I'd never seen
477520	478560	it in my yard before
478560	479840	so I didn't get it
479840	480640	in the early years
480640	481600	but I didn't collect
481600	482280	too frequently
482280	483420	in the early years.
484840	486320	And this is I think
486320	487140	one of those cases
