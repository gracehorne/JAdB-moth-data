0	8640	beginning, but here we go. So we left off at Diagramia Nepensis. I'm sorry, which one? Diagramia
8640	15900	Nepensis. So were we on Cold Canyon or were we on Davis? We're still doing Davis. I was looking
15900	22280	through Cold Canyon and you were simultaneously looking at the... Oh yeah. Oh. So do I have those?
22380	27440	Yes, I do. That's right. Well, you can have Cold Canyon then like we were doing before. Okay, yeah.
27440	35740	And if you want to go back and go through the species we skipped over now, we could do
35740	41060	it now or we could do it after we finish. Let's do it after. Yeah. So we can just keep going
41060	47120	the way we were because we were making good progress. Okay, that makes sense. There was
47120	56040	a monograph on Diagramia and I think I told you the date of that, but if you go to the
56040	64180	Moth Photographers Group, many times there is a link or a list of references you consult.
64340	70160	Okay. So on many species that I don't know about, you can look on Moth Photographers Group
70160	74160	and it'll direct you to a reference that might give you information that you'll find useful.
74160	77460	I'm hoping Sandy comes in today. I've brought in the Turkish cookbook.
77460	89700	You also would be able to confirm or refute some of the things that my failing memory might have gotten wrong.
89700	97460	So we're at Diagramia and Nepenza. And you were making notes on this, the electronic version, right?
97460	106460	Yeah. Okay. And the reason I mention that is because there's a monograph on Diagramia. In it, the known hosts are reported.
106460	122460	Nepenza is in a group of conifer feeding Diagramia. And as you know, there's no native conifers in the valley, so it's feeding on ornamentals, most likely.
122460	131460	And we have ornamental pines in my neighborhood, plus other people of various conifers in the neighborhood.
131460	135460	So all Diagramia are non-native?
135460	148460	No, Nepenza specifically. One of these is on Lotus. I don't remember. One's on Willow. They're on various hosts.
148460	159460	And whether they're specific or not really depends on what's been reported.
159460	171460	So you have to consider that everything is subject to further information.
171460	176460	And unfortunately, you know, Powell didn't publish most of his rearing records.
176460	187460	He reared, he says in that in a peanut paper that he had 12,000 larval collections at the time he published that.
187460	188460	Wow.
188460	198460	So there's a lot of data that he didn't report when Gaden Robinson was compiling his database.
198460	203460	Nepenza's feeds on conifers. That seems to be pretty clear.
203460	213460	But the species in the Nepenza's group of species, the conifer feeding ones, are variable and they're very difficult to identify.
213460	217460	And apparently the genitalia are not diagnostic.
217460	228460	And whether DNA can separate the species or not, I can't tell from reading the Mona Fasca.
228460	230460	So which are the ones that are hard to identify?
230460	234460	Digramia Nepenza's we're talking about now. The conifer feeding one.
234460	238460	And that's the only one that feeds on conifers?
238460	239460	Yes.
239460	240460	Okay.
240460	257460	And Greg and Folker Heinrich, who's, you know, collects in this area, they have listed more species in this group than I have.
257460	271460	But Folker's not comfortable with his identification because he's not content with the work that was done in the fascicle.
271460	274460	I could go on about that, but I won't.
274460	279460	Ectomyelois serotonii was an invasive species.
279460	289460	And I think it first showed up a year, I think Greg got one specimen a year before I got my first specimen.
289460	293460	Then we had a couple of years when I got around 20 or so.
293460	298460	And then it's been declining in numbers since then.
298460	302460	One of the common names is the locust beam moth.
302460	305460	So I guess it feeds on locust.
305460	309460	Another one is the carob moth.
309460	318460	So it was known from Florida and then Southern California before it turned up here.
318460	326460	And it took me several years to identify it and I finally found it in a paper on Chinese moths.
326460	329460	And I said, oh, that's our moth.
329460	338460	But it was in the literature, but I didn't think we had it here because it was only known from Florida and Southern California at the time.
338460	340460	So it might have moved north.
340460	344460	The last year or two, I haven't gotten it, so.
344460	345460	Okay.
345460	349460	Greg, though, has reported it, but he could be wrong.
351460	354460	I need to see many of his moths in order to come.
354460	359460	He's coming in later today, actually, with things he collected this year.
359460	366460	Amelina monodactyla is a pterophorid that feeds on morning glory.
366460	372460	It's quite variable, quite common.
372460	378460	Pterophorids in general do not seem to be strongly attracted to light.
378460	385460	So you don't get them unless you're somewhere near a host plant.
385460	391460	They don't seem to stray very far either, but they get around nonetheless.
395460	404460	The Festia Cuniella, I think, has a common name and I think it's a somewhat polyphagous.
404460	416460	You know, all these categories we have for journalists, specialists, monophagous, polyphagous,
416460	423460	I think they're trying to pigeonhole things that are more complicated than simple categories.
423460	432460	And I haven't detected it in recent years, so this is one that seems to come and go.
432460	434460	A Festia Cuniella, you mean?
434460	435460	Yeah.
435460	437460	It looks like you did, right?
437460	439460	Well, I don't know.
439460	440460	Oh, I'm sorry.
440460	442460	Yeah, maybe ones or zeros.
442460	444460	I don't know.
444460	447460	But some years it's more common than others.
447460	457460	And I think I get it more frequently at Cold Cannon than I do at Davis.
457460	460460	All of these Fisotines are difficult to identify.
460460	470460	They're all, most of them are gray and white, gray, black, and white.
470460	472460	Some have some brown.
472460	474460	But they're all kind of drab.
474460	478460	They're different kind of size categories of all of them.
478460	484460	You can break them into two separate groups on the basis of wing venation without doing dissection.
484460	487460	And that kind of narrows your search down.
487460	495460	But, you know, one of the species that I identified just yesterday is new to this area.
495460	501460	But a nearly identical species was reported by Bill Patterson at Quail Ridge.
501460	506460	So I need to check to see if those are correctly identified now.
506460	508460	Mm-hmm.
508460	515460	The Fisotines, Gilbastatella, I think it's called the false raisin moth or something like that.
515460	518460	I think it's a scavenger.
518460	528460	And, in fact, from time to time, if I catch a specimen and put it in my relaxer, and it's a female,
528460	531460	sometimes they lay eggs after they're dead.
531460	536460	And the larvae that come out will eat other moths that are in the relaxer with it.
536460	542460	So it probably scavenges on various dead plant and animal material.
542460	544460	God, the amount of stuff that's in your brain, John.
544460	547460	Even though it's known as a stored product.
547460	555460	So, like, you had a big area of, like, no collecting it here?
555460	561460	That doesn't make sense to me because it's the most common moth in Davis.
561460	564460	I have 20,000 specimens plus.
564460	566460	But is that true for Cold Canyon?
566460	580460	I think it's fairly common at Cold Canyon, but it might be the most common species there of Fisotide moth there, but I don't know.
580460	583460	I'll go back through my data.
583460	596460	You know, the Cold Canyon data in general needs a more, you know, it needs to be updated the same way that I did with the Davis data.
596460	598460	I thought it was.
598460	599460	No.
599460	603460	Well, that's why we were linking the names and everything.
603460	611460	And the Davis data, all of the names are in order in the same, and they're, like, all harmonized.
611460	613460	But that's not the case.
613460	621460	We made a list of synonyms, which were mostly errors that were on the various annual spreadsheets.
621460	634460	But I did not go back and correct all the mistakes in the annual spreadsheets, nor have I done it yet on the summary data sheet.
634460	644460	But if you've made the corrections to the names, your data is probably in better shape than mine.
644460	645460	Oh, okay.
645460	647460	So yours is further along?
647460	652460	At least the names are in better shape than mine.
652460	653460	Okay.
653460	658460	I mean, I was only working on making that STEM son, a summary of what's going on there.
658460	659460	Oh, I understand.
659460	660460	Okay.
660460	663460	And I was less concerned about the annual data.
663460	664460	Got it.
664460	665460	Okay.
665460	666460	Why am I sending you a picture of chin?
666460	669460	The achromius we've discussed over and over again.
669460	682460	And the achromius ocellia and californicalis are variable in abundance.
682460	685460	This year was a big year for ocellia.
685460	694460	Last year I dissected every ocellia that I collected, every achromius that I collected, and all were ocellia.
694460	700460	This year I found one californicalis among all of those that I collected.
700460	701460	They were down.
701460	707460	And early in the year, ocellia was doing well, but later in the year it petered out.
707460	708460	Yeah.
708460	713460	This year in general, the season seemed to be early.
713460	714460	Mm-hmm.
714460	718460	Not only did things show up earlier, but they petered out earlier.
718460	719460	Mm-hmm.
719460	729460	So whether that's due to the, I think it's probably because July was so hot.
729460	732460	You know, it was record heat in July.
732460	736460	As we go through, can you tell us when you know a species is non-native?
736460	739460	Have you been telling us every time?
739460	741460	If it's an introduced species?
741460	742460	Mm-hmm.
742460	744460	Yeah, I'll mention it at the time.
744460	751460	Some of these it's not known, you know, because they've been around for so long.
751460	767460	Eudonia, Spencer Rye, it's been collected consistently, but its abundance is inconsistent from year to year.
767460	776460	And I'm not sure what this one feeds on, but it's in one of the monofascicles, so it might be reported.
776460	777460	That's so weird.
777460	780460	Is it, do you know if it's native or not?
780460	783460	It appears to be native.
783460	784460	Oh, okay.
784460	791460	And the other species, the one that's common at, um, called Canyon, Rectilinia.
791460	792460	Rectilinia.
792460	795460	I think that one feeds on oaks.
795460	799460	But I would need to verify that.
799460	802460	No, it was inexplicable.
802460	803460	Also native?
803460	805460	Or presumed native?
805460	806460	Who or what this came from.
806460	807460	I'm sorry?
807460	808460	Rectilinia?
808460	809460	Also, yeah.
809460	810460	Right, okay.
810460	812460	It seems to be only in the west.
812460	817460	So, uh, most introduced species are fairly widely distributed.
817460	818460	Right.
818460	820460	And that is not.
820460	829460	Eupathisia mendicata, um, or similar species.
829460	833460	This, the eupathisia part is truncated on mine.
833460	834460	Oh, it's cut off.
834460	835460	Oopsie.
835460	836460	What?
836460	838460	Uh, it's this, it's this genus.
838460	839460	No, it's mendicata.
839460	840460	Yeah, that's genus.
840460	841460	That's the genus.
841460	842460	Oh.
842460	843460	That's navadatta, though.
843460	844460	But it's that genus.
844460	845460	That's the genus.
845460	847460	That's navadatta, though.
847460	848460	But it's that genus.
848460	849460	So, I think it's misspelled.
849460	850460	Right.
850460	851460	I think it needs an E right here.
851460	852460	Yeah.
852460	854460	That's why this is showing up.
854460	855460	Yeah, there needs to be an E.
855460	856460	This is navadatta.
856460	857460	That's why it's on order.
857460	858460	That's why it's on order.
858460	859460	I don't know.
859460	860460	This is a picture of a baby.
860460	863460	I tell you, I'm a master of typos.
863460	866460	I mean, it might have been on our end.
866460	873460	I sent some of these to Cliff Ferris, who wrote a recent monograph on eupathisia.
873460	874460	Yeah.
874460	879460	And these are formerly in another genus, which has now been lumped with eupathisia.
879460	888460	And he disagreed that they were Mandicata, but when I dissected them, they match the genitalic
888460	893460	illustrations better than what he thought they were.
893460	898460	So, that's why, or similar species.
898460	907460	And there may be more than one species included in this.
907460	909460	I don't know what it feeds on.
909460	923460	However, Mariah Robinson reared similar moths on adenostoma, which we don't have here in Davis.
923460	927460	So, it probably feeds on adenostoma and other.
927460	930460	That's a rosaceae, I believe.
930460	932460	Is it presumed native?
932460	936460	Almost certainly, yeah.
936460	946460	And I would think probably, I can't speculate on whether it's so specific or not.
946460	955460	There's an old monograph by McDonough on eupathisia that can be downloaded off the internet.
955460	958460	And the link is on the Moth Photographers group.
958460	964460	And then a more recent one that's available that Ferris did.
964460	970460	But Ferris didn't discuss life history information the same way that McDonough did.
970460	971460	Okay.
971460	976460	Eupathisia Miserulata.
976460	981460	I don't know that I have that from Cold Canyon.
981460	982460	You don't.
982460	983460	You don't.
983460	984460	You have Miserulata.
984460	988460	I think here in Davis is probably feeding on sunflowers.
988460	989460	Oh, that M.
989460	990460	Hi.
990460	991460	Oh, I'm sorry.
991460	992460	I'm sorry.
992460	993460	I was like, didn't we already say M?
993460	994460	Yeah.
994460	995460	You don't go by M, right?
995460	996460	People call me all kinds of stuff.
996460	997460	Oh, okay.
997460	998460	At my house.
998460	1005460	Probably feeding on sunflowers, which my neighbor grows every year.
1005460	1011460	And it's known, however, from other composites.
1011460	1021460	And this year I got two in my yard after not getting any for a while.
1021460	1026460	Miserulata seems to be more polyphagous.
1026460	1031460	Plus it has a much longer flight season than most of the other Eupathisia.
1031460	1038460	There's a number of early species, some midsummer and maybe some late species.
1038460	1042460	But Miserulata is found throughout the years.
1042460	1054460	There's a very different looking moth that has a similar looking genitalia that's found on the coast.
1054460	1062460	And I think they might be different forms of the same moth, but I don't know that for certain.
1062460	1069460	I don't think that anybody has done DNA scans of these.
1069460	1071460	Which is unfortunate.
1071460	1082460	Ferris had access to the types, but I don't think he had the ability to do DNA analyses.
1082460	1090460	Euzola septentrionalis is similar to a lot of other euzola species.
1090460	1095460	And so there's a possibility that errors have been made here.
1095460	1110460	I got the original identification from Ron Robertson, who was very careful to tell me whether he was certain or uncertain about the identification.
1110460	1114460	So he was fairly confident that these were correct.
1114460	1119460	And just recently, it's really exploded in numbers here in Davis.
1119460	1128460	But I got some that look a little bit strange this year, and I'm halfway through the dissections.
1128460	1133460	And they may turn out to be a different species.
1133460	1135460	Did they arrive here, you think, in Davis?
1135460	1137460	No, I don't think they arrived here.
1137460	1142460	I just, that I first detected them in 2005 and didn't get them.
1142460	1147460	And this could be, this is a late flying species.
1147460	1148460	Oh.
1148460	1157460	So it could be that I just wasn't collecting late enough in the year to detect them.
1157460	1159460	Your data should account for that though, right?
1159460	1162460	Because you're looking at the flight window.
1162460	1163460	Mm-hmm.
1163460	1164460	The common collection window.
1164460	1170460	Yeah, for the common, yeah, this is for, this is for the full data set, but the common collection window would catch that.
1170460	1171460	Okay, good.
1171460	1174460	We're just making sure we have a catch for that in the analysis.
1174460	1175460	Yeah.
1175460	1180460	Yuzoa is a difficult genus, but there was a somewhat recent monograph on it.
1180460	1193460	However, I have sent photographs of specimens that I couldn't identify to the person who wrote the monograph, and he's given me the wrong identifications on them.
1193460	1194460	Jesus Christ.
1194460	1195460	Yes.
1195460	1206460	Same thing happened with a friend who worked on an endemic fly at a hot, a local hot spring.
1206460	1213460	You know, and he sent them to the person who described it for confirmation, and he identified it as something else.
1213460	1218460	And then when he said, well, I thought, and he said, oh, I forgot about that species, so.
1218460	1219460	Mm-hmm.
1219460	1220460	You're just gonna have to never die, John.
1220460	1226460	If you don't work on things all the time, you know, the whoosh, the names come and go.
1226460	1232460	That's why, in a way, it's better to collect from one place all the time than a lot of places once in a while.
1232460	1233460	Yeah.
1233460	1234460	Sounds like it.
1234460	1235460	Okay.
1235460	1239460	I turned the wrong, moving the wrong direction here.
1239460	1240460	Okay.
1240460	1246460	Feltia subterranea is, I think it has a common name.
1246460	1247460	It's a common name.
1247460	1249460	It's a common species.
1249460	1250460	Is it a pest?
1250460	1254460	And many of these, I think it has sometimes a pest.
1254460	1255460	Granulate cutworm.
1255460	1257460	Sounds crusty to me.
1257460	1258460	Yeah.
1258460	1259460	So it's a cutworm.
1259460	1261460	So it's probably, it's a generalist.
1261460	1269460	I think it's sometimes gets in lawns and, but mostly it's a cutworm and it probably is an occasional, but not a major pest.
1269460	1278460	It's variable and some individuals look like other species.
1278460	1294460	But this has a very bright white hindwing and I base my identifications as much on the hindwing color and brightness as the forewing where most of the pattern is.
1294460	1299460	So I think most have been identified correctly.
1299460	1310460	Far more common in Davis than at Cold Canyon, which is the case for most of these pest species of Noctuits.
1310460	1313460	So it's a Noctuit.
1313460	1318460	Philatoma species.
1318460	1327460	Philatoma, like Cayennotes, is a fairly large genus that needs revisions.
1327460	1335460	I don't know if this is one species or more, and I don't know whether it's the same species as the ones I'm calling B or C.
1335460	1347460	A few philatoma that I've collected have been identified, but I don't, I haven't ventured to identify the ones from Davis.
1347460	1357460	I only got a couple of them this year, and I called one species A and one species B, but whether they're different species, I don't know.
1357460	1361460	I've dissected a number to confirm that they're philatoma.
1361460	1376460	Males are easy to identify, but females look like females of morphologically similar species, but, and you need to look at the genitalia to be certain what they are.
1376460	1399460	Fercula cneroides was originally recorded as cneria, and I think all of the species names have been modified to reflect the new thinking on this, the cneroides.
1399460	1402460	Feeds on willows, I believe.
1402460	1409460	So any decline in my yard might be attributable to my cutting the willow tree down in my yard.
1409460	1413460	This one, it's in decline in, um, stubs too. Cnerioides?
1413460	1422460	Yeah, Fercula is the genus cnerioides, and it used to be cneria, c-i-n-e-r-e-a.
1422460	1424460	Yeah, that's not even here.
1424460	1436460	And in that recent monophacicle, um, several subspecies were upgraded to full, were given full species status.
1436460	1439460	Yeah, it looks like it's declining.
1439460	1452460	But, you know, Wagner was a co-author, and he doesn't agree with some of the decisions that were made, and I don't know, uh, whether they were fingerprinted or not.
1452460	1457460	I love the Fercula caterpillars, because they have little tails.
1457460	1458460	Oh!
1458460	1459460	They're so cute.
1459460	1464460	This, it's the natadonids, and natadonids are known as prominents.
1464460	1468460	And that's because the larvae tend to be prominent.
1468460	1469460	Cool.
1469460	1471460	I always wondered why they were called that.
1471460	1472460	Yeah.
1472460	1476460	They refer to the larvae that way, I mean, usually, but I've seen it.
1476460	1477460	Yeah.
1477460	1481460	So, that's one that's in decline both in Davis and in stebs, it looks like.
1481460	1483460	Well, it could be, yeah.
1483460	1502460	Yeah, you know, the fires, the fires are more damaging to trees and shrubs than they were to, uh, you know, the annuals and the, some of the perennials endure fire, you know, they stump shoot and they come back.
1502460	1509460	So, whatever, the willows at Cold Canyon are in the stream bed, mostly.
1509460	1511460	So, those were protected from fire pretty well.
1511460	1513460	So, those would have been preserved, yeah.
1513460	1530460	But, I, I have a sense that large moths, in general, go through longer population cycles of, um, decline and increase than do smaller moths.
1530460	1538460	But, maybe that's just because I've, you know, they're, they're easier to collect and see.
1538460	1539460	Have aander.
1539460	1540460	Yeah.
1540460	1545880	That's because it's within a few years like dozens of them are good at school, I solve it for-
1545880	1546880	That's great.
1546880	1548880	Right.
1548880	1550880	So, there's one for me to tell theassio where, you know.
1550880	1552880	You don't know how much of again this disease.
1552880	1553960	Surely not something that has failedcho.
1553960	1557880	I, uh, go through this as well.
1557880	1560880	Having這個 solve the problem begins.
1560880	1564460	Urine, probably, obviously, were your decision.
1564580	1565880	Do you?
