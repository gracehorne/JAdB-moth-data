1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
beginning, but here we go. So we left off at Diagramia Nepensis. I'm sorry, which one? Diagramia

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,900
Nepensis. So were we on Cold Canyon or were we on Davis? We're still doing Davis. I was looking

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,280
through Cold Canyon and you were simultaneously looking at the... Oh yeah. Oh. So do I have those?

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,440
Yes, I do. That's right. Well, you can have Cold Canyon then like we were doing before. Okay, yeah.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:35,740
And if you want to go back and go through the species we skipped over now, we could do

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,060
it now or we could do it after we finish. Let's do it after. Yeah. So we can just keep going

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,120
the way we were because we were making good progress. Okay, that makes sense. There was

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,040
a monograph on Diagramia and I think I told you the date of that, but if you go to the

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:04,180
Moth Photographers Group, many times there is a link or a list of references you consult.

10
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:10,160
Okay. So on many species that I don't know about, you can look on Moth Photographers Group

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,160
and it'll direct you to a reference that might give you information that you'll find useful.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,460
I'm hoping Sandy comes in today. I've brought in the Turkish cookbook.

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:29,700
You also would be able to confirm or refute some of the things that my failing memory might have gotten wrong.

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,460
So we're at Diagramia and Nepenza. And you were making notes on this, the electronic version, right?

15
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:46,460
Yeah. Okay. And the reason I mention that is because there's a monograph on Diagramia. In it, the known hosts are reported.

16
00:01:46,460 --> 00:02:02,460
Nepenza is in a group of conifer feeding Diagramia. And as you know, there's no native conifers in the valley, so it's feeding on ornamentals, most likely.

17
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:11,460
And we have ornamental pines in my neighborhood, plus other people of various conifers in the neighborhood.

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,460
So all Diagramia are non-native?

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:28,460
No, Nepenza specifically. One of these is on Lotus. I don't remember. One's on Willow. They're on various hosts.

20
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:39,460
And whether they're specific or not really depends on what's been reported.

21
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:51,460
So you have to consider that everything is subject to further information.

22
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,460
And unfortunately, you know, Powell didn't publish most of his rearing records.

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:07,460
He reared, he says in that in a peanut paper that he had 12,000 larval collections at the time he published that.

24
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Wow.

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:18,460
So there's a lot of data that he didn't report when Gaden Robinson was compiling his database.

26
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Nepenza's feeds on conifers. That seems to be pretty clear.

27
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:33,460
But the species in the Nepenza's group of species, the conifer feeding ones, are variable and they're very difficult to identify.

28
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,460
And apparently the genitalia are not diagnostic.

29
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:48,460
And whether DNA can separate the species or not, I can't tell from reading the Mona Fasca.

30
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
So which are the ones that are hard to identify?

31
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,460
Digramia Nepenza's we're talking about now. The conifer feeding one.

32
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,460
And that's the only one that feeds on conifers?

33
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Yes.

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Okay.

35
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:17,460
And Greg and Folker Heinrich, who's, you know, collects in this area, they have listed more species in this group than I have.

36
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:31,460
But Folker's not comfortable with his identification because he's not content with the work that was done in the fascicle.

37
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,460
I could go on about that, but I won't.

38
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Ectomyelois serotonii was an invasive species.

39
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:49,460
And I think it first showed up a year, I think Greg got one specimen a year before I got my first specimen.

40
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Then we had a couple of years when I got around 20 or so.

41
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,460
And then it's been declining in numbers since then.

42
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,460
One of the common names is the locust beam moth.

43
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,460
So I guess it feeds on locust.

44
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Another one is the carob moth.

45
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:18,460
So it was known from Florida and then Southern California before it turned up here.

46
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:26,460
And it took me several years to identify it and I finally found it in a paper on Chinese moths.

47
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,460
And I said, oh, that's our moth.

48
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:38,460
But it was in the literature, but I didn't think we had it here because it was only known from Florida and Southern California at the time.

49
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,460
So it might have moved north.

50
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,460
The last year or two, I haven't gotten it, so.

51
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
Okay.

52
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,460
Greg, though, has reported it, but he could be wrong.

53
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,460
I need to see many of his moths in order to come.

54
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,460
He's coming in later today, actually, with things he collected this year.

55
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Amelina monodactyla is a pterophorid that feeds on morning glory.

56
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,460
It's quite variable, quite common.

57
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,460
Pterophorids in general do not seem to be strongly attracted to light.

58
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,460
So you don't get them unless you're somewhere near a host plant.

59
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,460
They don't seem to stray very far either, but they get around nonetheless.

60
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:44,460
The Festia Cuniella, I think, has a common name and I think it's a somewhat polyphagous.

61
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:56,460
You know, all these categories we have for journalists, specialists, monophagous, polyphagous,

62
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,460
I think they're trying to pigeonhole things that are more complicated than simple categories.

63
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:12,460
And I haven't detected it in recent years, so this is one that seems to come and go.

64
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,460
A Festia Cuniella, you mean?

65
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
Yeah.

66
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
It looks like you did, right?

67
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
Well, I don't know.

68
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Yeah, maybe ones or zeros.

70
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
I don't know.

71
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,460
But some years it's more common than others.

72
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:37,460
And I think I get it more frequently at Cold Cannon than I do at Davis.

73
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,460
All of these Fisotines are difficult to identify.

74
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:50,460
They're all, most of them are gray and white, gray, black, and white.

75
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,460
Some have some brown.

76
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
But they're all kind of drab.

77
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,460
They're different kind of size categories of all of them.

78
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,460
You can break them into two separate groups on the basis of wing venation without doing dissection.

79
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,460
And that kind of narrows your search down.

80
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:15,460
But, you know, one of the species that I identified just yesterday is new to this area.

81
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,460
But a nearly identical species was reported by Bill Patterson at Quail Ridge.

82
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,460
So I need to check to see if those are correctly identified now.

83
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Mm-hmm.

84
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,460
The Fisotines, Gilbastatella, I think it's called the false raisin moth or something like that.

85
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,460
I think it's a scavenger.

86
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:48,460
And, in fact, from time to time, if I catch a specimen and put it in my relaxer, and it's a female,

87
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,460
sometimes they lay eggs after they're dead.

88
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,460
And the larvae that come out will eat other moths that are in the relaxer with it.

89
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,460
So it probably scavenges on various dead plant and animal material.

90
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
God, the amount of stuff that's in your brain, John.

91
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Even though it's known as a stored product.

92
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:15,460
So, like, you had a big area of, like, no collecting it here?

93
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:21,460
That doesn't make sense to me because it's the most common moth in Davis.

94
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,460
I have 20,000 specimens plus.

95
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
But is that true for Cold Canyon?

96
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:40,460
I think it's fairly common at Cold Canyon, but it might be the most common species there of Fisotide moth there, but I don't know.

97
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,460
I'll go back through my data.

98
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:56,460
You know, the Cold Canyon data in general needs a more, you know, it needs to be updated the same way that I did with the Davis data.

99
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
I thought it was.

100
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
No.

101
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Well, that's why we were linking the names and everything.

102
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:11,460
And the Davis data, all of the names are in order in the same, and they're, like, all harmonized.

103
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
But that's not the case.

104
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:21,460
We made a list of synonyms, which were mostly errors that were on the various annual spreadsheets.

105
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:34,460
But I did not go back and correct all the mistakes in the annual spreadsheets, nor have I done it yet on the summary data sheet.

106
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:44,460
But if you've made the corrections to the names, your data is probably in better shape than mine.

107
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Oh, okay.

108
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
So yours is further along?

109
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,460
At least the names are in better shape than mine.

110
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Okay.

111
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,460
I mean, I was only working on making that STEM son, a summary of what's going on there.

112
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Oh, I understand.

113
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Okay.

114
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,460
And I was less concerned about the annual data.

115
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
Got it.

116
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Okay.

117
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
Why am I sending you a picture of chin?

118
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
The achromius we've discussed over and over again.

119
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:22,460
And the achromius ocellia and californicalis are variable in abundance.

120
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
This year was a big year for ocellia.

121
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Last year I dissected every ocellia that I collected, every achromius that I collected, and all were ocellia.

122
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,460
This year I found one californicalis among all of those that I collected.

123
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
They were down.

124
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,460
And early in the year, ocellia was doing well, but later in the year it petered out.

125
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Yeah.

126
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,460
This year in general, the season seemed to be early.

127
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Mm-hmm.

128
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Not only did things show up earlier, but they petered out earlier.

129
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Mm-hmm.

130
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:09,460
So whether that's due to the, I think it's probably because July was so hot.

131
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,460
You know, it was record heat in July.

132
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,460
As we go through, can you tell us when you know a species is non-native?

133
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Have you been telling us every time?

134
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
If it's an introduced species?

135
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Mm-hmm.

136
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Yeah, I'll mention it at the time.

137
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Some of these it's not known, you know, because they've been around for so long.

138
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Eudonia, Spencer Rye, it's been collected consistently, but its abundance is inconsistent from year to year.

139
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:56,460
And I'm not sure what this one feeds on, but it's in one of the monofascicles, so it might be reported.

140
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
That's so weird.

141
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Is it, do you know if it's native or not?

142
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,460
It appears to be native.

143
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
Oh, okay.

144
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:11,460
And the other species, the one that's common at, um, called Canyon, Rectilinia.

145
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Rectilinia.

146
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,460
I think that one feeds on oaks.

147
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,460
But I would need to verify that.

148
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,460
No, it was inexplicable.

149
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Also native?

150
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Or presumed native?

151
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Who or what this came from.

152
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,460
I'm sorry?

153
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Rectilinia?

154
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Also, yeah.

155
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
Right, okay.

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
It seems to be only in the west.

157
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,460
So, uh, most introduced species are fairly widely distributed.

158
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Right.

159
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
And that is not.

160
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Eupathisia mendicata, um, or similar species.

161
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,460
This, the eupathisia part is truncated on mine.

162
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
Oh, it's cut off.

163
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Oopsie.

164
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
What?

165
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Uh, it's this, it's this genus.

166
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
No, it's mendicata.

167
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
Yeah, that's genus.

168
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
That's the genus.

169
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Oh.

170
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
That's navadatta, though.

171
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
But it's that genus.

172
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
That's the genus.

173
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
That's navadatta, though.

174
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
But it's that genus.

175
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
So, I think it's misspelled.

176
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Right.

177
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
I think it needs an E right here.

178
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,460
Yeah.

179
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,460
That's why this is showing up.

180
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Yeah, there needs to be an E.

181
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
This is navadatta.

182
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
That's why it's on order.

183
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
That's why it's on order.

184
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
I don't know.

185
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
This is a picture of a baby.

186
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
I tell you, I'm a master of typos.

187
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,460
I mean, it might have been on our end.

188
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I sent some of these to Cliff Ferris, who wrote a recent monograph on eupathisia.

189
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Yeah.

190
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,460
And these are formerly in another genus, which has now been lumped with eupathisia.

191
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:48,460
And he disagreed that they were Mandicata, but when I dissected them, they match the genitalic

192
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,460
illustrations better than what he thought they were.

193
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,460
So, that's why, or similar species.

194
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:07,460
And there may be more than one species included in this.

195
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
I don't know what it feeds on.

196
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:23,460
However, Mariah Robinson reared similar moths on adenostoma, which we don't have here in Davis.

197
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,460
So, it probably feeds on adenostoma and other.

198
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
That's a rosaceae, I believe.

199
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Is it presumed native?

200
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Almost certainly, yeah.

201
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:46,460
And I would think probably, I can't speculate on whether it's so specific or not.

202
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:55,460
There's an old monograph by McDonough on eupathisia that can be downloaded off the internet.

203
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,460
And the link is on the Moth Photographers group.

204
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,460
And then a more recent one that's available that Ferris did.

205
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,460
But Ferris didn't discuss life history information the same way that McDonough did.

206
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Okay.

207
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Eupathisia Miserulata.

208
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,460
I don't know that I have that from Cold Canyon.

209
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
You don't.

210
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
You don't.

211
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,460
You have Miserulata.

212
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I think here in Davis is probably feeding on sunflowers.

213
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Oh, that M.

214
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Hi.

215
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

216
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
I was like, didn't we already say M?

218
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Yeah.

219
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
You don't go by M, right?

220
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
People call me all kinds of stuff.

221
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
Oh, okay.

222
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
At my house.

223
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:45,460
Probably feeding on sunflowers, which my neighbor grows every year.

224
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,460
And it's known, however, from other composites.

225
00:16:51,460 --> 00:17:01,460
And this year I got two in my yard after not getting any for a while.

226
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Miserulata seems to be more polyphagous.

227
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Plus it has a much longer flight season than most of the other Eupathisia.

228
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:18,460
There's a number of early species, some midsummer and maybe some late species.

229
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,460
But Miserulata is found throughout the years.

230
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:34,460
There's a very different looking moth that has a similar looking genitalia that's found on the coast.

231
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:42,460
And I think they might be different forms of the same moth, but I don't know that for certain.

232
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:49,460
I don't think that anybody has done DNA scans of these.

233
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Which is unfortunate.

234
00:17:51,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Ferris had access to the types, but I don't think he had the ability to do DNA analyses.

235
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Euzola septentrionalis is similar to a lot of other euzola species.

236
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,460
And so there's a possibility that errors have been made here.

237
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:30,460
I got the original identification from Ron Robertson, who was very careful to tell me whether he was certain or uncertain about the identification.

238
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,460
So he was fairly confident that these were correct.

239
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,460
And just recently, it's really exploded in numbers here in Davis.

240
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:48,460
But I got some that look a little bit strange this year, and I'm halfway through the dissections.

241
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,460
And they may turn out to be a different species.

242
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Did they arrive here, you think, in Davis?

243
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
No, I don't think they arrived here.

244
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,460
I just, that I first detected them in 2005 and didn't get them.

245
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,460
And this could be, this is a late flying species.

246
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Oh.

247
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:17,460
So it could be that I just wasn't collecting late enough in the year to detect them.

248
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
Your data should account for that though, right?

249
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Because you're looking at the flight window.

250
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Mm-hmm.

251
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
The common collection window.

252
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Yeah, for the common, yeah, this is for, this is for the full data set, but the common collection window would catch that.

253
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Okay, good.

254
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,460
We're just making sure we have a catch for that in the analysis.

255
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Yeah.

256
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Yuzoa is a difficult genus, but there was a somewhat recent monograph on it.

257
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:53,460
However, I have sent photographs of specimens that I couldn't identify to the person who wrote the monograph, and he's given me the wrong identifications on them.

258
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Jesus Christ.

259
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Yes.

260
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Same thing happened with a friend who worked on an endemic fly at a hot, a local hot spring.

261
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,460
You know, and he sent them to the person who described it for confirmation, and he identified it as something else.

262
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,460
And then when he said, well, I thought, and he said, oh, I forgot about that species, so.

263
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Mm-hmm.

264
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
You're just gonna have to never die, John.

265
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,460
If you don't work on things all the time, you know, the whoosh, the names come and go.

266
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,460
That's why, in a way, it's better to collect from one place all the time than a lot of places once in a while.

267
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Yeah.

268
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Sounds like it.

269
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Okay.

270
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,460
I turned the wrong, moving the wrong direction here.

271
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Okay.

272
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Feltia subterranea is, I think it has a common name.

273
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
It's a common name.

274
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
It's a common species.

275
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
Is it a pest?

276
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,460
And many of these, I think it has sometimes a pest.

277
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Granulate cutworm.

278
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Sounds crusty to me.

279
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Yeah.

280
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
So it's a cutworm.

281
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
So it's probably, it's a generalist.

282
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:09,460
I think it's sometimes gets in lawns and, but mostly it's a cutworm and it probably is an occasional, but not a major pest.

283
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:18,460
It's variable and some individuals look like other species.

284
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:34,460
But this has a very bright white hindwing and I base my identifications as much on the hindwing color and brightness as the forewing where most of the pattern is.

285
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,460
So I think most have been identified correctly.

286
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Far more common in Davis than at Cold Canyon, which is the case for most of these pest species of Noctuits.

287
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,460
So it's a Noctuit.

288
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Philatoma species.

289
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Philatoma, like Cayennotes, is a fairly large genus that needs revisions.

290
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:15,460
I don't know if this is one species or more, and I don't know whether it's the same species as the ones I'm calling B or C.

291
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:27,460
A few philatoma that I've collected have been identified, but I don't, I haven't ventured to identify the ones from Davis.

292
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:37,460
I only got a couple of them this year, and I called one species A and one species B, but whether they're different species, I don't know.

293
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I've dissected a number to confirm that they're philatoma.

294
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Males are easy to identify, but females look like females of morphologically similar species, but, and you need to look at the genitalia to be certain what they are.

295
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Fercula cneroides was originally recorded as cneria, and I think all of the species names have been modified to reflect the new thinking on this, the cneroides.

296
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Feeds on willows, I believe.

297
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:29,460
So any decline in my yard might be attributable to my cutting the willow tree down in my yard.

298
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,460
This one, it's in decline in, um, stubs too. Cnerioides?

299
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:42,460
Yeah, Fercula is the genus cnerioides, and it used to be cneria, c-i-n-e-r-e-a.

300
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Yeah, that's not even here.

301
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:56,460
And in that recent monophacicle, um, several subspecies were upgraded to full, were given full species status.

302
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Yeah, it looks like it's declining.

303
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:12,460
But, you know, Wagner was a co-author, and he doesn't agree with some of the decisions that were made, and I don't know, uh, whether they were fingerprinted or not.

304
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,460
I love the Fercula caterpillars, because they have little tails.

305
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Oh!

306
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
They're so cute.

307
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,460
This, it's the natadonids, and natadonids are known as prominents.

308
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,460
And that's because the larvae tend to be prominent.

309
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Cool.

310
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
I always wondered why they were called that.

311
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Yeah.

312
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,460
They refer to the larvae that way, I mean, usually, but I've seen it.

313
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Yeah.

314
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,460
So, that's one that's in decline both in Davis and in stebs, it looks like.

315
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Well, it could be, yeah.

316
00:24:43,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Yeah, you know, the fires, the fires are more damaging to trees and shrubs than they were to, uh, you know, the annuals and the, some of the perennials endure fire, you know, they stump shoot and they come back.

317
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,460
So, whatever, the willows at Cold Canyon are in the stream bed, mostly.

318
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
So, those were protected from fire pretty well.

319
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
So, those would have been preserved, yeah.

320
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:30,460
But, I, I have a sense that large moths, in general, go through longer population cycles of, um, decline and increase than do smaller moths.

321
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:38,460
But, maybe that's just because I've, you know, they're, they're easier to collect and see.

322
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Have aander.

323
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Yeah.

324
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,880
That's because it's within a few years like dozens of them are good at school, I solve it for-

325
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
That's great.

326
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
