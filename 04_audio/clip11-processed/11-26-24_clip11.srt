1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
time to time. Spodoptera, see, Spodoptera was still the most common

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,620
to a metrida by yard this year, but it was down in numbers.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,120
Do you think that it's native?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,000
But again, that's...

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,000
Pyralis farinalis is a stored...

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,860
It's the grain moth, the egg grain moth, or something like that. Farina. Farina is what, some kind of boiled wheat product or something.

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,560
A porridge type thing.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,840
It's a cereal anyway. So I think this feeds on cereals, and it has quite a range of sizes,

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,460
and I've never seen it in my house, and I guess people have found it infesting stored grains,

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,320
but maybe mostly sile, and silage or something, but it shows up in my yard at almost any time of the year, and

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,020
never in great numbers.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:21,260
And I thought it'd been kind of consistently inconsistent, but you show that your model suggests that it's declining, which could be true.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:31,840
You know, a lot of these stored products bests may exploit compost, too.

14
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:42,900
So if people are composting, that's a possibility, I'll say, augmenting their population.

15
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,340
Oh, that one, yeah.

16
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,760
Pyrasta californicalis feeds on various mints and flies both during the day and at night.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:06,740
So this is a tiny moth with bright yellow-orange hindwings, and you'll often see it, say, around rosemary during the day.

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,280
Or if you have any blooming mint plant during the day, you'll see.

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:24,000
So I thought that maybe what we were saying is, if I turn the light on early, ones that were active during the day, when it gets dark, go to the light.

20
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,980
But it's clear that some of them are flying well after sunset.

21
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:40,100
So I think it's just one of these species that's both diurnally and nocturnally active.

22
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,140
Pyrasta lataclavia.

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,520
Powell told me that this is an introduced species.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,540
So I don't know that I ever got it at Cold Cannon.

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,980
And it has two very different forms.

26
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,220
One is very attractive, yellow and red.

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:08,500
And the other one is kind of a muddy, chestnut color with some marked markings.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,800
And I think they're seasonal, but I'm not certain.

29
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:21,820
And the one that's kind of muddy looking is very similar to a moth that is very common at Cold Cannon.

30
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,100
Pyrasta.

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,560
Moran Alice?

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
Moran Alice, yeah.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:36,380
And I've recorded Moran Alice from my yard now, but I'm not 100% certain that my identifications of these are correct.

34
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:50,160
And these were treated in one of the first Moth of North America monographs, but the photographs and the descriptive material are not.

35
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,440
So do you think this is really showing up here?

36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,820
Oh, this is lataclavia we're talking about now.

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,060
Oh, okay.

38
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,520
Got it.

39
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,480
But Volupialis is also an introduced species.

40
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,800
And the thinking is that these are being spread around on nursery stock.

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:21,060
And, you know, one of the places I like to buy plants from is, what do they call it, Morning Sun Herb Farm.

42
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,560
Do you know the place?

43
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,220
It's down on, what's the road?

44
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,460
The road that comes out at Solano Park, Pleasance Valley Road.

45
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
I don't know this place.

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,020
Yeah, okay.

48
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,060
So there's that park, you know, where people.

49
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:50,280
I went there to buy plants and, you know, she says, well, what are the moths eating our mints?

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,580
Because originally they were an herb farm, you know, they sold herbs.

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,540
They also grow ornamentals, mostly jolt-oled plants.

52
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,840
So I said, well, there's a number of them.

53
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,700
And I made her a little kit to show what they look like.

54
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,480
This one, once it showed up, I seem to be getting it fairly regularly.

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:28,340
So whether it came to my yard on some herb that I had brought in from an outdoor nursery room, I can't say.

56
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,500
But eventually it did show up at Cold Canyon.

57
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,900
And I think I have one or two records from Cold Canyon, but not enough for analysis, apparently.

58
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:58,600
There is a similar looking species at, a native species at Cold Canyon called Grotei, G-R-O-T-E-I.

59
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,680
He's probably on there.

60
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,240
I think the story went to some neighbor or friend of hers who said, why don't you call your daughter?

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,860
How else did Grotei is?

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
Maybe you don't have nothing.

63
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,280
And that eventually showed up in my yard.

64
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,420
Call my son.

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,140
Palupialis, and it's red with pale markings, just the same as Palupialis.

66
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,360
But the pattern is different.

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,180
That, you know, a casual look, you'll confuse one with the other.

68
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,020
So, are we at Spodoptera now?

69
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,460
Yes.

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:41,760
Spodoptera, Exigula, beet army worm, among another of hosts of common names.

71
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,100
And I didn't realize it, but it is an introduced species.

72
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,540
Well, at least you realized it.

73
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,580
Which may explain why it doesn't look like any of the other Spodoptera.

74
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:10,520
And it is by far the most common geometric in my yard, and is also very common at Cold Canyon.

75
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
But whether it's the most common one there or not, I'd have to check the numbers.

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:24,900
And there were some nights when I ran the light trap in the early years.

77
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,080
And there were so many Spodoptera, I said, I don't want to count them.

78
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,240
And sometimes when there's a lot of them at my light, I've made an estimate of how many are there.

79
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,240
A conservative estimate.

80
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:49,060
So, I record the number that I collect plus an estimate of the number that I didn't collect, which is usually around.

81
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,420
I didn't know you were collecting that.

82
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,220
I knew you were collecting the number that you collected, but not the estimated amount that you didn't collect.

83
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:05,580
But I only do that if I want to be more representative of how many actually showed up.

84
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,040
I mean, you have to make some decisions.

85
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
We can't do everything.

86
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,860
Yeah.

87
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,360
Yeah.

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,960
So, I don't know whether I was making those estimates in the beginning or not.

89
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,980
But this shows a decline.

90
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,480
You would think if I wasn't doing that in the beginning, it would show an even greater decline.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah.

92
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,340
It might show a false increase.

93
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:45,420
Spadoptera prefica, there's another species which looks almost exactly like it, called Orthogalli.

94
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,380
And there are reports of Orthogalli from around here, but I've been looking over these carefully.

95
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:08,160
And based on the character that I saw in the literature, I've never seen Orthogalli in my yard.

96
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,640
But there's a possibility that we do have Orthogalli and that it does show up.

97
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
This is an armyworm.

98
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,520
I think it's called yellow-striped armyworm or something like that.

99
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:33,040
And Greg's father owned a ranch in Knight's Landing, and he reported one year that these things were just all over the place.

100
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:42,200
So, this is something that is subject to outbreaks and then probably gets knocked down again, either by disease or parasitism.

101
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,340
And Wagner's been after me for the longest time to send him one for eggs.

102
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,860
So, that he can raise the larva.

103
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,920
And ever since I've looked for it, I've never gotten a female or never got a female that laid eggs.

104
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,200
Do you think it's native?

105
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,180
I think so.

106
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,860
He wants it desperately for his book.

107
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,280
For his book, so he can take pictures.

108
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,100
Yeah, his caterpillar book.

109
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,620
Well, if it's the softest...

110
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,020
I can't remember whether it was before I actually...

111
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,880
Stigmella, species number three.

112
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,280
Could be more than one species.

113
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,680
And then there's another one that may be just smaller individuals of species number three.

114
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,640
So, I've called all the ones that are kind of like me.

115
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,060
The one that's very distinct is Stigmella, species number two.

116
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,220
And this is irrelevant because what I called one, two, and three in Davis are not the same as one, two, and three.

117
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,880
Well, one, two, and three are not here.

118
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah.

119
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,280
Like, at all.

120
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,820
So, maybe they just are not abundant enough?

121
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
Probably not enough of them.

122
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,480
So, is that a more urban species?

123
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,720
Because we get those on Quercus lobata all the time.

124
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,760
It's a Deptocula and it's a Leafbinder.

125
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,020
Yeah.

126
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,180
And so, Leafbinders are very host-specific.

127
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,620
And it could be an urban species or it could be one that I just don't collect very often.

128
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,460
Because they're on the Quercus lobata, which is in Cold Canyon.

129
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,660
Well, I don't know what this one feeds up on.

130
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,660
Stigmella.

131
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,360
So, they might actually be, like, species-specific, like, host-specific by species and not genus?

132
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:31,940
Well, other leaf-mining species sometimes are specific at the oak species level.

133
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,920
And others are specialists on Quercus or in closely related.

134
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,140
So, if they feed an agrifolia, they'll also get on whyslazenia, you know, the hard leaf.

135
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,280
But I don't know if this feeds on oak or anything else in my yard.

136
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,200
I've not looked for mines on anything.

137
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,460
It just shows up for some reason.

138
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,680
And over the years, I've learned where it tends to land on my light sheet.

139
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,840
Whoa, like how close to the light?

140
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,180
So, it tends to be at the very top of the sheet and in the center where the light is.

141
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,220
So, I think they land on the sheet and then skitter up to the top of the sheet.

142
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,160
And a great number of the tiny moths do the same thing.

143
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,900
So, this is what I call a minute moth.

144
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,740
So, this is too small for most people to spread.

145
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,580
You know, it's like the size of a...

146
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,000
...aumatidia in an average-sized moth.

147
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,400
They're very, very small.

148
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:41,240
And many of them, I have to use the smallest size minutons available in order to pin them.

149
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,300
And then, if you try to spin them, spread them, it's just dumb luck.

150
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,700
You know, either they spread or they don't.

151
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
More often than not, they don't.

152
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,900
So, I just pin them up.

153
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,960
You know, I guess if...

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Like I said, most of these leaf miners have been identified by being collected as larvae.

155
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,640
But there is a monograph on Stigmella that was done by some guy in...

156
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,460
If you could offer me that job, I wouldn't have taken it because it's just...

157
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,180
One of the Scandinavian countries.

158
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
Well, it just looked boring.

159
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,720
Wilkinson, his name was.

160
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,280
It's super boring.

161
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,060
It's available.

162
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,380
I mean, you know.

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,880
And then...

164
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,800
Not that some of the stuff that I have done is...

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,940
Don Davis at the Smithsonian prepared a Mona monograph on it, but it never got published.

166
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:34,560
And I think for the reason that they figure nobody gives a rat's ass about my new moth that they can't see or spread.

167
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,440
But you still get the...

168
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,360
I get rats ass.

169
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,000
They don't want to go to the expense of publishing a book that only libraries and...

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Well, it's one of the reasons I've been kind of mad.

171
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,800
Crazy people like me.

172
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,460
...letting me label his Arizona bees that have code numbers.

173
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,880
But, you know, back when I was in graduate school, first in graduate school, so that was...

174
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,380
Well, he keeps saying that's a good idea, but it never happened.

175
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,080
So around almost 50, 45 years ago now, Don Davis showed me the pictures that he had.

176
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,140
You know, they all were hand-drawn.

177
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,880
They didn't use photography.

178
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,220
They're beautiful pictures.

179
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,520
He says, this is ready for publication.

180
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
45 years later, it still hasn't been published.

181
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,180
And I hear Don Davis is not in good health, so it probably will never publish.

182
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,320
He said that he told him that...

183
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,040
Samoka Signatella is in the same family that Otto's stickity with Egoconia that we discussed

184
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,400
early.

185
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:39,300
And this one, unlike Egoconia, shows up with some regularity at Cold Canyon, as well as in my yard.

186
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:49,260
And I don't know anything about Egoconia, nor do I know whether it's stated or not.

187
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,460
But that's a very small family.

188
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:02,920
And before it had been, it and Egoconia had been bounced around among a number of different

189
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,460
families, including, I think, Lester Basis.

190
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,460
Let me stop this and take a quick...
