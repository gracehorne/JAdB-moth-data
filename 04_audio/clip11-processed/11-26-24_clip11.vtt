WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.300
time to time. Spodoptera, see, Spodoptera was still the most common

00:05.300 --> 00:08.620
to a metrida by yard this year, but it was down in numbers.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.120
Do you think that it's native?

00:16.920 --> 00:19.000
But again, that's...

00:21.740 --> 00:28.000
Pyralis farinalis is a stored...

00:28.000 --> 00:37.860
It's the grain moth, the egg grain moth, or something like that. Farina. Farina is what, some kind of boiled wheat product or something.

00:38.140 --> 00:39.560
A porridge type thing.

00:39.680 --> 00:47.840
It's a cereal anyway. So I think this feeds on cereals, and it has quite a range of sizes,

00:49.840 --> 00:56.460
and I've never seen it in my house, and I guess people have found it infesting stored grains,

00:56.460 --> 01:05.320
but maybe mostly sile, and silage or something, but it shows up in my yard at almost any time of the year, and

01:06.320 --> 01:09.020
never in great numbers.

01:09.020 --> 01:21.260
And I thought it'd been kind of consistently inconsistent, but you show that your model suggests that it's declining, which could be true.

01:21.260 --> 01:31.840
You know, a lot of these stored products bests may exploit compost, too.

01:31.980 --> 01:42.900
So if people are composting, that's a possibility, I'll say, augmenting their population.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.340
Oh, that one, yeah.

01:44.340 --> 01:51.760
Pyrasta californicalis feeds on various mints and flies both during the day and at night.

01:51.760 --> 02:06.740
So this is a tiny moth with bright yellow-orange hindwings, and you'll often see it, say, around rosemary during the day.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.280
Or if you have any blooming mint plant during the day, you'll see.

02:10.280 --> 02:24.000
So I thought that maybe what we were saying is, if I turn the light on early, ones that were active during the day, when it gets dark, go to the light.

02:24.460 --> 02:31.980
But it's clear that some of them are flying well after sunset.

02:31.980 --> 02:40.100
So I think it's just one of these species that's both diurnally and nocturnally active.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.140
Pyrasta lataclavia.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.520
Powell told me that this is an introduced species.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.540
So I don't know that I ever got it at Cold Cannon.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.980
And it has two very different forms.

02:54.140 --> 03:00.220
One is very attractive, yellow and red.

03:00.220 --> 03:08.500
And the other one is kind of a muddy, chestnut color with some marked markings.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.800
And I think they're seasonal, but I'm not certain.

03:13.100 --> 03:21.820
And the one that's kind of muddy looking is very similar to a moth that is very common at Cold Cannon.

03:21.980 --> 03:23.100
Pyrasta.

03:24.080 --> 03:24.560
Moran Alice?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.400
Moran Alice, yeah.

03:26.400 --> 03:36.380
And I've recorded Moran Alice from my yard now, but I'm not 100% certain that my identifications of these are correct.

03:36.380 --> 03:50.160
And these were treated in one of the first Moth of North America monographs, but the photographs and the descriptive material are not.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.440
So do you think this is really showing up here?

03:53.980 --> 03:56.820
Oh, this is lataclavia we're talking about now.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.060
Oh, okay.

03:58.060 --> 03:58.520
Got it.

03:58.580 --> 04:02.480
But Volupialis is also an introduced species.

04:03.760 --> 04:09.800
And the thinking is that these are being spread around on nursery stock.

04:09.800 --> 04:21.060
And, you know, one of the places I like to buy plants from is, what do they call it, Morning Sun Herb Farm.

04:21.780 --> 04:22.560
Do you know the place?

04:23.240 --> 04:28.220
It's down on, what's the road?

04:28.460 --> 04:32.460
The road that comes out at Solano Park, Pleasance Valley Road.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.160
I don't know this place.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.020
Yeah, okay.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.060
So there's that park, you know, where people.

04:42.700 --> 04:50.280
I went there to buy plants and, you know, she says, well, what are the moths eating our mints?

04:50.280 --> 04:55.580
Because originally they were an herb farm, you know, they sold herbs.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.540
They also grow ornamentals, mostly jolt-oled plants.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.840
So I said, well, there's a number of them.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.700
And I made her a little kit to show what they look like.

05:10.520 --> 05:17.480
This one, once it showed up, I seem to be getting it fairly regularly.

05:17.480 --> 05:28.340
So whether it came to my yard on some herb that I had brought in from an outdoor nursery room, I can't say.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.500
But eventually it did show up at Cold Canyon.

05:35.660 --> 05:40.900
And I think I have one or two records from Cold Canyon, but not enough for analysis, apparently.

05:40.900 --> 05:58.600
There is a similar looking species at, a native species at Cold Canyon called Grotei, G-R-O-T-E-I.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.680
He's probably on there.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.240
I think the story went to some neighbor or friend of hers who said, why don't you call your daughter?

06:05.560 --> 06:06.860
How else did Grotei is?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.920
Maybe you don't have nothing.

06:10.060 --> 06:12.280
And that eventually showed up in my yard.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.420
Call my son.

06:13.640 --> 06:19.140
Palupialis, and it's red with pale markings, just the same as Palupialis.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.360
But the pattern is different.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.180
That, you know, a casual look, you'll confuse one with the other.

06:25.180 --> 06:31.020
So, are we at Spodoptera now?

06:31.300 --> 06:31.460
Yes.

06:32.840 --> 06:41.760
Spodoptera, Exigula, beet army worm, among another of hosts of common names.

06:42.940 --> 06:47.100
And I didn't realize it, but it is an introduced species.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.540
Well, at least you realized it.

06:48.540 --> 06:53.580
Which may explain why it doesn't look like any of the other Spodoptera.

06:58.140 --> 07:10.520
And it is by far the most common geometric in my yard, and is also very common at Cold Canyon.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.560
But whether it's the most common one there or not, I'd have to check the numbers.

07:14.560 --> 07:24.900
And there were some nights when I ran the light trap in the early years.

07:25.160 --> 07:31.080
And there were so many Spodoptera, I said, I don't want to count them.

07:32.220 --> 07:38.240
And sometimes when there's a lot of them at my light, I've made an estimate of how many are there.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.240
A conservative estimate.

07:40.240 --> 07:49.060
So, I record the number that I collect plus an estimate of the number that I didn't collect, which is usually around.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.420
I didn't know you were collecting that.

07:51.720 --> 07:56.220
I knew you were collecting the number that you collected, but not the estimated amount that you didn't collect.

07:56.220 --> 08:05.580
But I only do that if I want to be more representative of how many actually showed up.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.040
I mean, you have to make some decisions.

08:11.540 --> 08:12.540
We can't do everything.

08:12.680 --> 08:12.860
Yeah.

08:13.180 --> 08:13.360
Yeah.

08:13.360 --> 08:19.960
So, I don't know whether I was making those estimates in the beginning or not.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.980
But this shows a decline.

08:24.520 --> 08:30.480
You would think if I wasn't doing that in the beginning, it would show an even greater decline.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.520
Yeah.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.340
It might show a false increase.

08:34.340 --> 08:45.420
Spadoptera prefica, there's another species which looks almost exactly like it, called Orthogalli.

08:49.800 --> 08:56.380
And there are reports of Orthogalli from around here, but I've been looking over these carefully.

08:56.380 --> 09:08.160
And based on the character that I saw in the literature, I've never seen Orthogalli in my yard.

09:08.720 --> 09:14.640
But there's a possibility that we do have Orthogalli and that it does show up.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.880
This is an armyworm.

09:15.980 --> 09:19.520
I think it's called yellow-striped armyworm or something like that.

09:19.520 --> 09:33.040
And Greg's father owned a ranch in Knight's Landing, and he reported one year that these things were just all over the place.

09:33.320 --> 09:42.200
So, this is something that is subject to outbreaks and then probably gets knocked down again, either by disease or parasitism.

09:45.260 --> 09:49.340
And Wagner's been after me for the longest time to send him one for eggs.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.860
So, that he can raise the larva.

09:51.680 --> 09:58.920
And ever since I've looked for it, I've never gotten a female or never got a female that laid eggs.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.200
Do you think it's native?

10:01.280 --> 10:02.180
I think so.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.860
He wants it desperately for his book.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.280
For his book, so he can take pictures.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.100
Yeah, his caterpillar book.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.620
Well, if it's the softest...

10:08.620 --> 10:11.020
I can't remember whether it was before I actually...

10:11.020 --> 10:12.880
Stigmella, species number three.

10:14.660 --> 10:16.280
Could be more than one species.

10:16.280 --> 10:22.680
And then there's another one that may be just smaller individuals of species number three.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.640
So, I've called all the ones that are kind of like me.

10:25.980 --> 10:30.060
The one that's very distinct is Stigmella, species number two.

10:30.940 --> 10:37.220
And this is irrelevant because what I called one, two, and three in Davis are not the same as one, two, and three.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.880
Well, one, two, and three are not here.

10:39.240 --> 10:39.500
Yeah.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.280
Like, at all.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.820
So, maybe they just are not abundant enough?

10:44.180 --> 10:45.500
Probably not enough of them.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.480
So, is that a more urban species?

10:47.660 --> 10:49.720
Because we get those on Quercus lobata all the time.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.760
It's a Deptocula and it's a Leafbinder.

10:51.820 --> 10:52.020
Yeah.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.180
And so, Leafbinders are very host-specific.

10:56.240 --> 11:02.620
And it could be an urban species or it could be one that I just don't collect very often.

11:02.620 --> 11:07.460
Because they're on the Quercus lobata, which is in Cold Canyon.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.660
Well, I don't know what this one feeds up on.

11:15.100 --> 11:15.660
Stigmella.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.360
So, they might actually be, like, species-specific, like, host-specific by species and not genus?

11:21.360 --> 11:31.940
Well, other leaf-mining species sometimes are specific at the oak species level.

11:31.940 --> 11:38.920
And others are specialists on Quercus or in closely related.

11:39.220 --> 11:44.140
So, if they feed an agrifolia, they'll also get on whyslazenia, you know, the hard leaf.

11:45.660 --> 11:49.280
But I don't know if this feeds on oak or anything else in my yard.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.200
I've not looked for mines on anything.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.460
It just shows up for some reason.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.680
And over the years, I've learned where it tends to land on my light sheet.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.840
Whoa, like how close to the light?

12:01.840 --> 12:08.180
So, it tends to be at the very top of the sheet and in the center where the light is.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.220
So, I think they land on the sheet and then skitter up to the top of the sheet.

12:13.180 --> 12:17.160
And a great number of the tiny moths do the same thing.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.900
So, this is what I call a minute moth.

12:20.020 --> 12:23.740
So, this is too small for most people to spread.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.580
You know, it's like the size of a...

12:26.580 --> 12:31.000
...aumatidia in an average-sized moth.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.400
They're very, very small.

12:32.400 --> 12:41.240
And many of them, I have to use the smallest size minutons available in order to pin them.

12:41.740 --> 12:45.300
And then, if you try to spin them, spread them, it's just dumb luck.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.700
You know, either they spread or they don't.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.680
More often than not, they don't.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.900
So, I just pin them up.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.960
You know, I guess if...

12:52.960 --> 12:59.840
Like I said, most of these leaf miners have been identified by being collected as larvae.

13:00.240 --> 13:06.640
But there is a monograph on Stigmella that was done by some guy in...

13:06.640 --> 13:09.460
If you could offer me that job, I wouldn't have taken it because it's just...

13:09.460 --> 13:11.180
One of the Scandinavian countries.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.320
Well, it just looked boring.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.720
Wilkinson, his name was.

13:13.980 --> 13:14.280
It's super boring.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.060
It's available.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.380
I mean, you know.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.880
And then...

13:17.880 --> 13:19.800
Not that some of the stuff that I have done is...

13:19.800 --> 13:25.940
Don Davis at the Smithsonian prepared a Mona monograph on it, but it never got published.

13:25.940 --> 13:34.560
And I think for the reason that they figure nobody gives a rat's ass about my new moth that they can't see or spread.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.440
But you still get the...

13:35.440 --> 13:36.360
I get rats ass.

13:36.380 --> 13:41.000
They don't want to go to the expense of publishing a book that only libraries and...

13:41.000 --> 13:42.640
Well, it's one of the reasons I've been kind of mad.

13:42.660 --> 13:43.800
Crazy people like me.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.460
...letting me label his Arizona bees that have code numbers.

13:48.740 --> 13:53.880
But, you know, back when I was in graduate school, first in graduate school, so that was...

13:53.880 --> 13:55.380
Well, he keeps saying that's a good idea, but it never happened.

13:56.940 --> 14:04.080
So around almost 50, 45 years ago now, Don Davis showed me the pictures that he had.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.140
You know, they all were hand-drawn.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.880
They didn't use photography.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.220
They're beautiful pictures.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.520
He says, this is ready for publication.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.240
45 years later, it still hasn't been published.

14:14.880 --> 14:19.180
And I hear Don Davis is not in good health, so it probably will never publish.

14:19.180 --> 14:21.320
He said that he told him that...

14:21.320 --> 14:28.040
Samoka Signatella is in the same family that Otto's stickity with Egoconia that we discussed

14:28.040 --> 14:28.400
early.

14:28.400 --> 14:39.300
And this one, unlike Egoconia, shows up with some regularity at Cold Canyon, as well as in my yard.

14:39.300 --> 14:49.260
And I don't know anything about Egoconia, nor do I know whether it's stated or not.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.460
But that's a very small family.

14:53.460 --> 15:02.920
And before it had been, it and Egoconia had been bounced around among a number of different

15:02.920 --> 15:06.460
families, including, I think, Lester Basis.

15:06.460 --> 15:10.460
Let me stop this and take a quick...
