0	7000	Yeah, anyway, I trust you to make all the decisions as far as the modeling and so forth.
7000	9000	Awesome. Yeah, it's great to hear that.
9000	15000	I'll give you some feedback, but, you know, it's not really criticism.
15000	18000	It's just something to consider.
18000	25000	In general, I want to give you feedback if it's something that pops out like that.
25000	26000	Yeah.
26000	33000	Correct me on these other situations with the name and quotation marks,
33000	37000	it means that they used to have this terminology,
37000	47000	and certainly, in Latin, which means uncertain placement.
47000	51000	These are ones where this is where they currently reside,
51000	54000	and those are probably wrong.
54000	60000	But the correct assignment is up for grads, or there's no correct assignment.
60000	65000	Yeah, I think we're reading this one.
65000	72000	This one, Crepe on Nana, for the longest time, I couldn't put a name on it.
72000	83000	And Tim McCabe, who's with New York State Department of Agriculture, had a girlfriend who used to work in the lab that I did before.
83000	88000	But he'd come out here from time to time, and he collected at Cold Canyon once when he was out there.
88000	91000	And he sent me a list of the species that he caught.
91000	94000	And a lot of them, he used names that I wasn't using.
94000	97000	And one of them was Crepe in Nana.
97000	105000	And Ron Robertson, who was my natural specialist before him, thought it was a new species.
105000	110000	He was able to identify it on the basis of genitalia as a Crepe.
110000	118000	But it was not a species that he knew, so he thought it was a new species.
118000	129000	And what is called Crepe in Nana, in our collection, in our collection, doesn't look very much like the specimens that I get called candy.
129000	134000	And this is a fairly common lot, even though there's a lot of zero in this here.
134000	142000	But it does look like pictures of what's called Danna on a line.
142000	158000	It does resemble pictures of Nana on a line.
158000	167000	And because Tim McCain, who doesn't communicate very much, gave me that name.
167000	169000	And that's what I decided to call him.
169000	172000	So I'm pretty comfortable with that name now.
172000	177000	I know nothing about the line.
177000	178000	Crepe in Oklahoma.
178000	179000	Crepe in Oklahoma.
179000	187000	I think it's one that they didn't have pictures on a lot of photographers.
187000	190000	This is kind of a hard mock to identify.
190000	192000	And I think the name is correct.
192000	201000	This is what Ron Robertson thought it was, so I attributed it to him.
201000	217000	You know, for any species that you choose to discuss individually, I, in general, recorded who gave me the identification.
217000	223000	And that's on a label in the unitary in the synoptic collection.
223000	229000	So we can shift the blame for being somebody else who can think for that.
229000	230000	Sounds good.
230000	231000	какие25
233000	234000	Yeah.
234000	236000	Exitelia, this was recently addressed.
236000	244000	Have you decided it doesn't fit the current definition of Exitelia.
244000	254000	You know, historically there were various groups among that were divided, and further divided, and further divided.
254000	263000	There's nobody worse than taxonomists for pigeonholing things, except maybe ecologists.
263000	266000	Ecologists need to find terms all the time.
266000	267000	These are general terms.
267000	269000	And they say, well, I don't equate this.
269000	272000	I think the new term is .
272000	274000	And the same thing happens.
274000	278000	So, you know, with butterflies, it's gotten ridiculous.
278000	281000	So that now there's almost as many general species.
281000	286000	The problem is you start obscuring the relationships.
286000	290000	I don't know which general are related to the others.
290000	293000	I think we need to bring back.
293000	295000	You know, there's not enough caterpillars.
295000	300000	That's part of the problem.
300000	304000	Well, they get out of the .
304000	306000	The grandosal is a very conspicuous moth.
306000	311000	So if I collected it as correct .
311000	312000	Oh, okay.
312000	313000	Yes.
313000	315000	Very conspicuous.
315000	316000	Right.
316000	318000	You know what would be helpful?
318000	324000	And you've shown the document is using one or another checklist number.
324000	329000	Because then you could just end in the checklist number and reference it back through the species.
329000	333000	Because the names will change with the checklist number and something like it will change.
333000	334000	Right.
334000	335000	Yeah.
335000	336000	Okay.
336000	342000	I'll just say recommendation in the future if there's something like this.
342000	350000	This is a very, I think it's, the pattern is very distinct.
350000	351000	Even though it's a small moth.
351000	352000	I can't use it.
352000	357000	There may be a similar species, but I don't think it's a .
357000	360000	I'm not correct with this one.
360000	361000	I don't.
361000	365000	Olivia de Vesta.
365000	378000	Originally I had it under some other genus, the name of which escapes me at the moment.
378000	388000	And it's kind of a, I hate this here, cherries to use it all the time.
388000	389000	Nondescript.
389000	394000	If you describe something that's nondescript, that's kind of an oxymoron.
394000	395000	But this is a nondescript.
395000	398000	It's not one that pops out.
398000	407000	So it's one that's hard to sight ID identified by faces of the image.
407000	414000	Because there's nothing obviously distinctive about it.
414000	418000	So until you've collected them over and over and over again, you don't recognize it.
418000	425000	But all of these nondescript forms are ones that have a greater probability of being
425000	426000	numerologically recorded.
426000	431000	And I think that's an important point to me.
431000	436000	Orthodes, quote, no, Burka.
436000	444000	I think it was in Polian report on the genus.
444000	448000	And I don't have the concept of what that is on my head.
448000	453000	And I'm surprised at the call point that I collected it often enough to be on here.
453000	455000	If I don't know what it is.
455000	461000	And it's one that I don't recollect collecting very much.
461000	475000	I think what I should do is print out five copies of at least the five-month-old life.
475000	477000	Yeah, I don't know.
477000	480000	It's kind of.
480000	486000	But that's what I was calling nondescript.
486000	491000	You know, if I was saying, well, what do you look for to identify that?
491000	496000	And I would have to say, properly identify .
496000	499000	I mean, that's the value of the synaptic collection.
499000	501000	Because you don't have to look through everything.
501000	503000	Bill Patterson, you know, right?
503000	506000	Before we had my photographic group, we'd come in here.
506000	509000	He'd go through drill after drill after drill after drill after drill.
509000	513000	And then over and over again.
513000	515000	That's a lot of work.
515000	516000	Absolutely.
516000	517000	Yeah.
517000	520000	So that would make it hard for him to give up his collection.
520000	525000	But he's not doing too well.
525000	530000	So he has an enormous butterfly collection.
530000	535000	And that was the last part of his collection that easily changed.
535000	538000	We used to find that before figuring out.
538000	540000	Arizona.
540000	543000	Recently, I just redefined Arizona.
543000	547000	But it's always been in Arizona, but not .
547000	553000	And this is a somewhat distinctive chain lecture.
553000	566000	I don't know too much about, I don't know very much about the life history.
566000	571000	But in general, I turned it not to look up the life histories of macros.
571000	576000	It was one of the other students of macros.
576000	577000	Okay.
577000	578000	Avigrotus.
578000	579000	Avigrotus.
579000	581000	We have one, two, three that you included.
581000	584000	But there's some other species that you didn't include.
584000	585000	Avigrotus.
585000	590000	No, you included just two of them.
590000	595000	I thought I had a box full of Avigrotus unidentified.
595000	596000	And I couldn't find it.
596000	598000	Well, I was rummaging around and I found it.
598000	603000	And it turned out that there's only four remaining that I couldn't identify.
603000	604000	Okay.
604000	606000	After I had done some dissection.
606000	609000	So there's four that I would likely dissect.
609000	612000	But that probably won't change things very much for you.
612000	622000	And I thought that there were some other species that were common enough to be included using the criteria that I'm not sure.
622000	637000	Malauri is very similar to a larger species with a more southerly distribution according to the monograph that includes the genus.
637000	650000	However, a lot of Southern California laws do extend a lot farther to the north than anybody thought in the valley and in the foothills.
650000	654000	But there hasn't been a lot of collectors who have stuff.
654000	658000	And collectors go to places that are cool.
658000	659000	The flashy places.
659000	660000	Yeah.
660000	675000	So I did have a couple of larger specimens of what looks like balauri.
675000	677000	And the genitalia of balauri.
677000	687000	And the southern species, the name of which escapes me right now.
687000	692000	And I retain here that it's deceptive and looks like balauri.
692000	697000	It could be that balauri is a mixture of the species.
697000	700000	And it could be that there's a species.
700000	717000	La Fontaine, who could the fascicle on the non-cturus, at least this group of non-cturus, the non-cturus, is a splitter.
717000	726000	So if they can find a reason to call one species, too, it's going to be two.
726000	732000	Chagonia is a smaller species of amigrotus.
732000	739000	And I think the females are dark brown and the males are light brown or the other way around.
739000	742000	I can't remember.
742000	754000	But it's unusual in that in most of the nocturus, in this genus of related genera,
754000	759000	the tip of the female abdomen is kind of flattened.
759000	765000	And the male abdomen is rounded all the way to the apex.
765000	770000	Well, this one, the female, is also rounded to the apex.
770000	775000	So you have to look a little closer to tell whether it's a male or female.
775000	786000	And there's another small species called canyon, which, if you looked at the distribution map,
786000	792000	and the monofascicles shouldn't be there.
792000	797000	But I just have to remember what it looks like, but it shouldn't be.
797000	800000	Well, the distribution map's there.
800000	803000	We're only at the specimens of the museum.
803000	810000	And after I, eventually I got both sepsis of it and it's a good match.
810000	818000	But amigrotus is a difficult change because a lot of the, there's a few distinct species,
818000	826000	but there's a lot of them that are similar to one or several other species.
826000	831000	So there are pairs or groups of species that are very similar to one another.
831000	841000	And when you're deceptive and you know what's in your memory and intention,
841000	843000	you're supposed to be in the one another again.
843000	847000	But every once in a while there's a possibility that something's real about it.
847000	850000	Unless you're alert for it, you listen.
850000	856000	And Surin and Arnalis is a very distinctive species.
856000	865000	I love to, flies, late winter, early spring.
865000	875000	So every specimen that I collected has been recorded.
875000	880000	The Chira Occidentalis, you know, we discussed the Chira before.
880000	885000	Ran Talvis is the one that's more widely distributed.
885000	891000	I think it's the one that's more widely distributed.
891000	897000	I think Occidentalis has a common name, but it may be the other one, I'm not sure.
897000	904000	I've not caught the ones that are called Ran Talis at Cope Canyon, or very seldom have caught them there,
904000	909000	whereas Ran Talis seems to be the dominant species in Davis.
909000	916000	And I've done a few dissections, but not a lot.
916000	922000	I don't know, I'd have to look to see whether I recorded NES or E or O.
922000	934000	But I don't think it would be proper if you're going to analyze them to combine the two together and insert the new model,
934000	942000	because I think they have very different types of books, ranges, and biologians, and so forth.
942000	945000	And that's the Dender, where they're combined spaces,
945000	956000	and through obscuring the patterns of each component of the combination.
956000	968000	Clarice Foley and the Tarchessa that feeds on the Mountain Mahogany.
968000	974000	And this is always a scientific name, because...
974000	988000	I have to do like a Heimlich maneuver to my brain to spurn out.
988000	993000	Arcane.
993000	1000000	It's the Mountain Mahogany, you know, Shepard Hill.
1000000	1005000	So it kind of comes, it goes, this is what it'll probably be.
1005000	1012000	You know, it might be better after fire, because...
1012000	1022000	There's not a lot of circle carcass like cocaine, and most of it is on the west faces, sort of,
1022000	1025000	and not on the bottom floor, or on the east.
1025000	1029000	So not in the places where I put them off that surround.
1029000	1031000	And the...
1031000	1033000	I can look at it a lot of them.
1033000	1048000	The Acrobasis Collisionella is quite difficult to tell apart by faces from Acrobasis...
1048000	1049000	Oh.
1049000	1050000	...concilla.
1050000	1051000	Concilla.
1051000	1052000	Got it.
1052000	1053000	Okay.
1053000	1055000	They'll stay on oaks.
1055000	1059000	Males are easy to tell apart because they have an antenna character.
1059000	1060000	Right.
1060000	1064000	Let's say they're present or absent.
1064000	1067000	But it's always absent on the females, so they're a little bit harder apart.
1067000	1074000	But once you separate them, you know, and you have a series of them, you can map them.
1074000	1076000	You're no longer new to.
1076000	1084000	But I mention that because there's quite a high probability that I have misidentified collisionella,
1084000	1088000	or confused collisionella with Comptella.
1088000	1091000	So the numbers of both could be wrong.
1091000	1092000	Mm-hmm.
1096000	1098000	But they're both suspicious.
1098000	1100000	They behave fairly near once.
1100000	1105000	If you want to turn sorry about Bill Patterson's before the...
1105000	1107000	...if you do, you do, you do, you do.
1107000	1109000	He said, oh, you know, now they look different.
1109000	1110000	They're separate.
1110000	1111000	You know.
1111000	1114000	He looked at them.
1114000	1115000	He's really good.
1115000	1117000	I couldn't tell.
1117000	1119000	The stuff couldn't tell the difference.
1119000	1120000	But I can see it.
1120000	1121000	You know.
1121000	1122000	Yes.
1122000	1125000	But it's hard sometimes to put into words.
1125000	1126000	What it is.
1126000	1127000	The things that we can see initially.
1127000	1128000	Yeah.
1128000	1130000	Like I could solve it on them.
1130000	1133000	Pecker makes a struggle now on the other hand.
1133000	1134000	Who knows?
1134000	1138000	Very different from the other two.
1138000	1149000	And as I mentioned, at Colcannon, it seems to be on Toyah more than anything.
1149000	1155000	And if I recall correctly, and it's always a danger, it plasters together a couple of leaves
1155000	1159000	and it's found in kind of a silken shelter.
1159000	1161000	So it doesn't roll the leaves anymore.
1161000	1165000	It just kind of plasters two together.
1165000	1170000	So it sees their numbers on to other leaves.
1170000	1173000	And they're, you get it throughout the year.
1173000	1175000	So there's probably more than that.
1175000	1176000	The other generation.
1176000	1177000	Of course, the ones on oak.
1177000	1179000	So they're just a central generation.
1179000	1183000	Probably because of the tannins of oak.
1183000	1185000	Makes it unpalatable.
1185000	1189000	Much of the year.
1189000	1194000	This acrolophic green genus movie.
1194000	1203000	Acrolophidae has been treated as a family from time to time, but also as a son family.
1203000	1210000	And that's how it's treated in New Checkers.
1210000	1216000	So it's an acrolofine in a way.
1216000	1226000	And I sent this to a specialist who is, they wanted to have a monophacical, but it probably won't be published.
1226000	1236000	Because all the models are kind of mousy-bound looking and look very much like one another.
1236000	1253000	And the exception between this and the other species, which are currently in the genus imagery, and there's two at Cold Canyon, is obvious.
1253000	1258000	This one, you look at the palpi, and the palpi are very different than the two that are in the genus imagery.
1258000	1274000	But the specialists who are doing the monochemists have decided that the two that are currently in the genus are in two different genera.
1274000	1284000	But I don't know that those two genera are differentiated on the basis of external characters or not.
1284000	1296000	With that said, all of the new genus, new species, are probably recorded and recorded as new genus, new species.
1296000	1302000	Whereas all of the amygia-like ones are recorded as one or the other.
1302000	1307000	And the ones that were recorded as one or the other were the ones that the specialists examined.
1307000	1312000	And all the others, I'm not going to disser.
1312000	1316000	He had a way of just teasing on them.
1316000	1320000	He could see things externally that would tell him whether they were one or the other.
1320000	1327000	After he teased on some of the hairline scales on the tip of the abdomen of both men and men,
1327000	1332000	and he tried to describe it to me that, you know, without saying it under high magnification,
1332000	1336000	he didn't have the ability to do it.
1336000	1339000	I couldn't have sold that.
1339000	1343000	And so I've just been recorded in this year or...
1343000	1355000	But he told me that there's probably another species here that was not among the dozens of specialists that I have done with them.
1355000	1359000	He's one of those rare cases where you send something else to a specialist
1359000	1363000	and the turnaround time is weeks rather than years.
1363000	1364000	Oh, wow.
1364000	1368000	He came back and everyone has a lot of family.
1368000	1374000	Probably because he's an amateur or other professional.
1374000	1378000	Acrolophus, careful.
1378000	1383000	Acrolophus is another acrolophus.
1383000	1385000	Acrolophus, fine.
1385000	1387000	And the tropics, these are...
1387000	1397000	A lot of the species have labial palates that come up and curve back well beyond the back of the head.
1397000	1398000	Wow.
1398000	1401000	But the ones we have out here are shorter though.
1401000	1410000	They don't have those enormous recurred labial palates.
1410000	1417000	Tear file items are larger species than it is the other one, Latta Capitania.
1417000	1420000	And I got it for the first time in my backyard this year.
1420000	1422000	No records before.
1422000	1425000	I've never caught Latta Capitania in my backyard.
1425000	1429000	And Latta Capitania is the very colony that called Penny.
1429000	1441000	Do you remember that night that we went out and I forgot to remind you and Emily that we were going to go collect?
1441000	1442000	That night was so windy.
1442000	1444000	We only got it out for a moment.
1444000	1445000	Yeah, in my life.
1445000	1446000	No.
1446000	1452000	But I think almost all the moss that we collected that night were acrolophus by the Capitania.
1452000	1465000	And these species, I don't know too much about the biology, but the acrolophus that are in the nutria, I think, are associated with rotent burrows.
1465000	1467000	That sort of situation.
1467000	1474000	And these may get an animal habitat as well.
1474000	1487000	You know, they're related to canelias and a lot of the canelias are female characters and hairs and horny materials and so forth.
1487000	1496000	So, you know, a good classification is allowing you to make certain predictions about the biology.
1496000	1497000	I don't know.
1497000	1498000	You know, I don't know.
1498000	1500000	It's easy, but it breaks down in some degrees.
1500000	1501000	It's a specimen maybe.
1501000	1502000	You can't do it.
1502000	1503000	Yeah.
1503000	1507000	And the fichita was my two or two.
1507000	1508000	Acronecta.
1508000	1510000	I don't know which one.
1516000	1521000	I originally recorded Acronecta infleda.
1521000	1532000	to it. It has two species, Impita and Impressa. So in some of the old spreadsheets, you see
1532000	1542000	both names. And there recently was a Mona, a classical donor. But Jeff, somebody had
1542000	1548000	borrowed all the material before and that person never worked on it. And eventually
1548000	1554000	the person who wrote the classical corral of all of those numbers. And there was nothing
1554000	1560000	to compare specimens with, because everybody had known their specimens to this person.
1560000	1563000	So that was like plotting them.
1563000	1568000	I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her, I'll get her.
1568000	1574000	So based on some photographs that I have, I thought they were just
1574000	1581000	variations of white species. And it turns out that Impita is much larger than Impressa
1581000	1590000	on that basis alone. But we had accumulated material here in the
1590000	1597000	that were not seen by the person who did the monograph. And Jeff sent him photographs
1597000	1606000	and he was able to identify strictly on the basis of photographs. And now that we have
1606000	1616000	a good reference, I think everything is correct. And I made errors. And I think most of these are
1616000	1623000	somewhat generous on trees and shrubs.
1623000	1633000	You know, that's why he's not raised. He's full of information. He gets a little cranky about
1633000	1638000	sharing it with other people from time to time. If he knows that you're going to use it
1638000	1645000	rather than you're just curious.
1645000	1651000	I talked to him just recently. He's making noise about retiring once it gets.
1651000	1653000	Oh, interesting.
1653000	1660000	Acronecta marmorata is the most common one. And we get it here in Davis. The other two species I've not seen in Davis.
1660000	1675000	In Marmorata, I think it's fairly widespread. And I think it probably in Davis is an oak moth. And it may be an oak moth in general.
1675000	1687000	Acronecta prodita is a very dark species with a white hindrance. So it's fairly easy to recognize.
1687000	1691000	And it's fairly easy to recognize.
1691000	1704000	The delphagrotus indeterminata we discussed in Davis. But again, early specimens might have been confused with what I was
1704000	1706000	calling .
1706000	1709000	Until that fascicle came out.
1709000	1714000	There's another species of the delphagrotus indeterminata in Southern California that I keep looking for because
1714000	1716760	in Southern California that I keep looking for,
1716760	1720760	because they look the same, except that the deltagrotus
1720760	1724760	endoterminata has a black prothoracic collar
1724760	1728240	that looks like the deltagrotus falminus.
1728240	1732520	Whereas the other one, I think it's called stovirus,
1732520	1738640	has a pale prothoracic collar.
1738640	1741560	And there's no reason why that species shouldn't be here,
1741560	1745320	but I haven't found it, I've never found it.
1749320	1752560	And I can not direct post-discollar.
1756560	1764560	This is in the depressority, which used to be a part of it.
1764560	1768320	Maybe it makes you sad.
1768320	1771320	They're hard to identify, don't they still think?
1771320	1778320	It used to be combined with the other decoformers.
1778320	1784320	There was some family that today, family, decoformers,
1784320	1787320	decoformers, as it appeared in the previous checklists,
1787320	1793320	is now at least two families, and I think three.
1793320	1795320	Three, and maybe four.
1795320	1800320	So stovat, stovat, stovat, with the other one.
1800320	1802320	And we don't have that deal.
1802320	1804320	So this is the decoformer.
1804320	1810320	And caterpillars are somewhat easy to find,
1810320	1813320	because they make shelters, and the shelters are big enough
1813320	1815320	that you can find them.
1815320	1821320	Toaster salad feeds on chaperone feed.
1821320	1822320	And we don't have to.
1822320	1823320	And they call it, um.
1823320	1824320	And they call it, um.
1824320	1825320	And they call it, um.
1825320	1826320	And they call it, um.
1826320	1827320	And they call it, um.
1827320	1828320	And they're just gonna charge anyway.
1828320	1829320	And they used to be, I don't know,
1829320	1834320	it's always showing me crazy how.
1834320	1839320	What's reaching this now?
1839320	1842320	I don't know, like, how a creeper is in India.
1842320	1843320	Yeah.
1843320	1844320	Yeah.
1844320	1845320	Yeah.
1845320	1846320	Yeah.
1846320	1847320	Yeah.
1847320	1848320	Yeah.
1848320	1850320	Yeah, I guess so.
1850320	1852320	But it was in something that started with,
1852320	1853320	I don't know.
1853320	1855320	Anyway, it was split off.
1855320	1858320	And one of the species, soralea,
1858320	1861320	is what it used to be, P-S-O-R-A.
1861320	1863320	So there's a species of agonoptera.
1863320	1865320	It's called soralea.
1865320	1869320	And, um, it's not included here.
1869320	1871320	But that also feeds on this plant.
1871320	1875320	And when I heard, um, um, soralea.
1875320	1878320	Soralea really explodes after fire.
1878320	1882320	So you would expect it to be more common after fire.
1882320	1886320	But this species, um,
1886320	1890320	Rosacella, seems to be fairly common,
1890320	1895320	regardless of whether it's a year or two after fire or not.
1895320	1898320	It was far more common than soralea.
1898320	1900320	But when I collected categories,
1900320	1903320	I don't think that I was a career with species.
1903320	1907320	But I did with soralea, which is selenken.
1907320	1910320	And all the species,
1910320	1916320	I believe all the species overwintered as adults.
1916320	1917320	So there's a,
1917320	1920320	that's why you get them throughout the years.
1920320	1922320	It's not because of multiple generations.
1922320	1925320	And like I said, they're flattened.
1925320	1930320	And that flattening enables them to hide in crevices and so forth.
1930320	1932320	So there's a reason why they flattened.
1932320	1936320	And that flattening is very common with overwintering species.
1936320	1937320	Oh, no.
1937320	1938320	Oh, okay.
1938320	1939320	Yeah.
1939320	1944320	So most of the deepest soralea are flattened that way.
1944320	1947320	Okay, which line was because ofpełic.
1947320	1948320	Yes.
1948320	1949320	Yes.
1949320	1950320	You know,
1950320	1952320	youankenixen for Megal Shepherd.
1952320	1954320	Okay, what else did you say,
1954320	1955320	let me just ask.
1955320	1956320	I didn't ask her if my question is,
1956320	1958320	how do you actually Henrietta
1958320	1960320	issue make sure you had that huge data,
1960320	1962320	what would you make sure you put this really bad pode?
1962320	1963320	In fact,
1963320	1966320	I didn't want to risk use all of these species a little bit
1966320	1968320	here right now.
1968320	1969320	And then that's like you otra interface
1969320	1970320	and I got to different些 species here.
1970320	1973120	And
1973120	1979620	Davis, where I was really, I used to be excited to get one system, but I think particularly
1979620	1991520	last year, I don't have that. I got more last year than all other years combined. I just
1991520	2005520	have this notion that in general, it goes through the long periods, long cycles of, you know, periodic,
2005520	2017520	and people who work on it, people who always like to attribute it to natural enemies.
2017520	2029520	But it could be disease, it could be herb creation, spider creation, and the same way.
2029520	2038520	It was fairly common at the Coal Canyon once I started collecting in those months.
2038520	2050520	And it has a very consistent pattern, but the brown color is not so consistent.
2050520	2060520	There are various earth patterns, from yellowish brown, to reddish brown, to chocolate brown,
2060520	2068520	and various shades of brown. You know, how all cars now seem to be different shades of gray.
2068520	2072520	I hate it. I'm looking like a navy here.
2072520	2086520	I brought this ipsilon that I talked about in Davis. It has some little black dash marks near the wing tips
2086520	2092520	and it seems to be, you know, they seem to be present, you know, the person who, the one that says,
2092520	2098520	they seem to be present even on the warm specimens.
2098520	2112520	Some of them look a little bit like some examples of feltria, subterranea, and also peridermal salsia.
2112520	2118520	And also it has that kind of bluish shade to the high end.
2118520	2121520	And feltria always has a white pioneer, so it is.
2121520	2125520	And then the dashes at the tip of the wing come out there.
2129520	2133520	I think, you know, Ragnar would say, well, how can you confuse them?
2133520	2142520	But I think in the east, the two species are more dissimilar than other than other than they are.
2142520	2148520	I'm saying that without ever having a collection in the east, so.
2148520	2150520	Not right.
2150520	2153520	Amarvia cune anemone.
2153520	2156520	I made some mistakes earlier.
2156520	2162520	There's a large eclairance that, because of its size and general appearance,
2162520	2165520	I may have recorded this Amarvia.
2165520	2178520	But I think Amarvia is later in the year, the adults are present later in the year than the Secranus speeches.
2178520	2188520	But I would say spring records of Amarvia are probably suspect.
2188520	2198520	And it's really a mistake I shouldn't have made, because the paltry are very different.
2198520	2203520	One has truncated paltry, and then one has...
2203520	2208520	Okay, I discussed the measure before.
2208520	2218520	This is where I, you, you analyze it, because this is where I recorded the bulk of the specimens,
2218520	2223520	all the ones that this specialist did.
2223520	2225520	Okay.
2225520	2227520	Well, I still don't think there was a piece of water.
2227520	2229520	So I know some of you, the issue of selection asks...
2229520	2236520	I'm going to kiss myself, and I think the rec packages, everything that I did not give have
2236520	2245240	and we've got close to every
2245240	2249520	threshold, I was saying all the vê碑, if I could make much more forヒ chop in,
2249520	2252520	what is it we're just looking for?
2252520	2265520	The column form has kind of a lot of white coloration on the leading edge of the four wings when outstretched.
2265520	2274520	And in varying amounts. And the pattern is otherwise created using blacks and whites.
2274520	2284520	Whereas the other one, the wing is about mostly down on the trailing edge with the wings outstretched.
2284520	2291520	And then slight gray on the rest of the wing. So they look very different.
2291520	2297520	And I've recorded them as two stations because I'm not sure.
2297520	2307520	But I have been mixed before. And this gray and brown form, the one I call in four species in there,
2307520	2314520	seems to be less abundant at Coltanian than it is in Davis.
2314520	2323520	But I'm leaning now much more towards calling in the same species because this year when it was very common in Davis,
2323520	2332520	I caught one or two specimens that were more intermediate than any between the two forms that I'd ever seen.
2332520	2340520	And how in, you know, the Western Moth book stated there's very amounts of balance on it.
2340520	2351520	Maybe he was referring to this other form with the slight gray, this predominantly straight slate gray.
2351520	2355520	So what do I hold here?
2355520	2363520	What I hold here...
