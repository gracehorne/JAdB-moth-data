00:00.960 --> 00:11.460
I always like separates, preferable to electronic, you know, because I never can find anything that I store as an electronic file.

00:11.820 --> 00:18.620
Yeah, yeah, it's a, that amount of information, that organization of it is something that most of us struggle with.

00:18.620 --> 00:32.740
I databased all of them before, but now when you buy the suite of office programs, they no longer provide the database.

00:32.740 --> 00:45.380
So I'm in the process of trying to convert what databases I still have to Lotus, one, two, three, Excel files.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.420
God, I'm stuck in the past.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.100
Technology moves faster than I do.

00:52.100 --> 00:52.820
Me too.

00:53.300 --> 00:53.780
You too.

00:54.580 --> 00:59.820
It won't be long before we're all Luddites.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.060
Buckeletric Albertiola I discussed at Davis.

01:08.320 --> 01:15.320
It's probably Albertiata, but there's many other species that look almost identical to it.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.380
Anyway, I did get a few in the text. I'll bring them in.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.480
Just, I just made up some way.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.680
Powell said that there is another species on oak that's similar to Alberti yellow.

01:27.680 --> 01:35.380
But I think I have that one as buccolatrix number such and such in my backyard.

01:35.380 --> 01:44.320
The ones that I call buccolatrix number one or two or three in my yard are different than the one, two, and three at Cold Canyon.

01:44.320 --> 02:03.000
So it's interesting to me that we have both buccolatrix ceanothiella and separabilis here because what I was calling separabilis is ceanothiella.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.500
It was misidentification, and I gave you a correction.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.680
But when I look here and here, these are the same.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.340
So that's why.

02:12.660 --> 02:13.020
That's why.

02:13.120 --> 02:13.700
It's just a duplicate.

02:13.700 --> 02:20.060
To replace separabilis with ceanothiella in your, for both, I think there's one Davis record.

02:21.560 --> 02:29.200
They're both kind of a white, tiny white moth with black markings, but they're very different from one another once you see the pictures.

02:30.200 --> 02:40.440
But I didn't have the pictures until recently, and I knew separabilis, which is on coyote bush, from the coast, and I assume that's what we had.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.400
But, you know, ceanothus is everywhere, so.

02:45.860 --> 02:46.400
Mm-hmm.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.240
Yeah, it's ornamental.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.040
So that's a discrepancy there.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.740
We'll fix it.

02:55.960 --> 03:03.380
And the rest of these buccolatrix are ones that I just assigned a number to.

03:03.380 --> 03:17.840
The one that I call buccolatrix tawny or something turned out to be a tishereid, and I think they've all been changed, but I can't say that with certainty.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.880
Bucolatrix have what they call eye caps, and that's expanded scales at the base of antennae over the eyes.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Yeah, I love those so much.

03:28.020 --> 03:28.900
They look like little puppies.

03:28.900 --> 03:37.220
And tishereids do not, and that's why I was always suspicious about that so-called tawny albertio.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.300
Where are we?

03:38.680 --> 03:39.560
So, her favorite word.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.980
Bucolatrix, you name it, yeah.

03:40.980 --> 03:41.020
Puppy.

03:41.620 --> 03:46.200
She just wakes up all morning, she says, puppy, puppy, puppy.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.880
Yesterday, she called a bird a puppy.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.040
My daughter's learning new words.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.340
That's so cute.

03:52.340 --> 03:59.100
The chaleptilia species slash species bee is probably more than one species.

03:59.600 --> 04:17.060
And these are all kind of, chaleptilia in general is an enormous genus found in many, maybe in every hemisphere of the world.

04:17.060 --> 04:43.820
And they're leaf miners that later make, most of which later make like a cone-shaped shelter on the same food plant in which they finish feeding, make their cocoon and pupa, and then emerge.

04:43.820 --> 04:54.260
And they stand on, with their forelegs stiffened and their tails sitting back.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.980
So, they're very easy to recognize on the sheet, even though they're tiny, longs.

05:01.340 --> 05:07.400
Species bee are all the ones that are kind of a, yeah, that's the posture.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.220
They look like tiger beetles.

05:11.220 --> 05:11.960
The way they sit.

05:11.980 --> 05:12.180
No, I don't know.

05:12.180 --> 05:19.920
It may be that most of these things that have kind of a peculiar posture or eye spots and everything are thought to be mimicking spiders.

05:20.660 --> 05:21.060
Interesting.

05:21.260 --> 05:21.620
Yeah, yeah.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.500
I see that.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.180
I mean, the legs look a lot like spiders.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.980
Other times, it's because they want to look twig-like.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.900
So, I don't know.

05:33.860 --> 05:36.080
The ones that I call bee are like this.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.400
They're kind of brown here.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.640
And then these little tick marks along the leading edge of the wing.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.240
That's a funny-looking moth.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.020
This is what, Wagner particularly liked these when he was in magic school.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.140
I think it's like a little tripod.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.260
I like it, too.

05:50.420 --> 05:50.540
Yeah.

05:50.540 --> 05:56.280
So, I recorded a number of the ones that look like that as this.

05:56.280 --> 06:02.280
And a couple of species were distinct and recorded by name or as some other thing.

06:02.280 --> 06:08.760
Like, there was a black one that we reared from ash only once.

06:09.400 --> 06:15.440
And there's a name for one called, there's a name for a calyptelia on ash called Fraxinella, of course.

06:15.440 --> 06:20.680
And that does not seem to be the species we have out here.

06:20.840 --> 06:29.100
But it's an enormous genus with many undescribed species and many that are difficult to tell apart.

06:29.540 --> 06:39.940
And very little available to the amateur to just differentiate them.

06:40.340 --> 06:41.120
Do you think they're native?

06:41.660 --> 06:42.060
Pardon me?

06:42.140 --> 06:43.000
Do you think they're native?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.800
Probably, because they're leafminers.

06:46.040 --> 06:46.180
Okay.

06:46.900 --> 06:50.500
And most leafminers are highly specialized.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.140
Mm-hmm.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.160
Okay.

06:52.220 --> 06:56.300
Sometimes even to the species within a larger genus.

06:56.580 --> 06:56.840
Mm-hmm.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.940
Choradrina postacella.

07:04.340 --> 07:08.720
This is a recent change in the genus.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.880
I don't know.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.860
It's a noctuit and I don't know much about the biology.

07:19.280 --> 07:26.040
I don't think this is one that's covered in any of the fascicles on noctuits.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.320
But it could be.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.980
If it is, it's probably under the old generic name.

07:31.980 --> 07:32.660
Oh, nice.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.840
I just fell back.

07:33.840 --> 07:33.860
I just fell back.

07:33.860 --> 07:34.240
I don't know.

07:34.240 --> 07:34.920
Yeah.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.680
We do have a shift in the...

07:35.680 --> 07:39.020
Catacula ilia zoe.

07:39.020 --> 07:39.120
Oh, okay.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.860
Catacula ilia has...

07:44.860 --> 07:48.060
Catacula are the underwing walls, you know, with the bright colors.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.040
So it's thought to be aposematic.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.720
You know, they flash this and cut it together.

07:53.720 --> 08:04.480
Catacula ilia has red hindwings with the black loops in it.

08:05.840 --> 08:13.360
But zoe, the western one, has yellow-orange hindwings.

08:13.360 --> 08:23.040
And that makes it very similar to another species that is reported from this area.

08:24.340 --> 08:25.940
And all the ones...

08:25.940 --> 08:32.500
I didn't realize that there were these two very similar species and I didn't make any comparisons.

08:32.500 --> 08:37.340
So it's possible that not all of these are this one species.

08:37.340 --> 08:44.800
And the other species, I'd have to look at them to see what the name of it is.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.040
But like Shapiro and a number of other people have reported seeing this to me from time to...

08:51.040 --> 08:52.960
The other species from time to time.

08:53.240 --> 08:59.920
And I've always wondered whether they think that ilia always has red hindwings and it's a misidentification.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.080
But the other one seems to be out here.

09:04.540 --> 09:05.060
Directly.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.900
Catacula is very popular.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.100
See how it has a red hindwing there?

09:10.340 --> 09:11.140
Yeah, it's a handsome wall.

09:11.140 --> 09:12.700
But that's not the case out here.

09:12.860 --> 09:13.120
Okay.

09:14.440 --> 09:19.620
But the pattern of the forewings is different than the pattern of the other one.

09:19.920 --> 09:24.380
It's different, but not startlingly different.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.940
Houseplant? Native? Non-native?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.000
I think most Catacula are native.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.320
And I think all of them feed on trees and shrubs.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.020
And I don't know how host-specific they are.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.040
Popular with collectors.

09:41.040 --> 09:41.160
Yes.

09:41.160 --> 09:53.320
Variliana is the more common species of Catacula with a red hindwing.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.500
It's a smaller one.

09:56.500 --> 10:06.180
I'm surprised some of the other species didn't show up in sufficient abundance to make the list.

10:06.180 --> 10:12.780
Often, you know, they're very strong flyers.

10:13.700 --> 10:18.120
And often what happens is they come in, hit the sheet, they fly off, never to return.

10:19.120 --> 10:26.080
And I think that could be the case with a lot of fast-flying moths.

10:26.080 --> 10:34.640
And, you know, it doesn't make me upset because often they come back later, but not always.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.020
Cyanotes brownella.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.760
Cyanotes is a chelikea.

10:42.120 --> 10:48.660
Another one with the wings flat across the back of the body.

10:48.660 --> 10:53.860
And it's known to be on lupins.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.260
And I don't know what other food plants.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.240
I never reared it myself, but it's one of the more common ones at Cold Canyon.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.400
But I've never seen it at Davis.

11:05.900 --> 11:06.960
Yep, yep, I see it.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.560
Cyanotes johnstidae.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.200
There was another species that looks very much like this called Cyanotes restio.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.000
And it kind of disappeared.

11:23.540 --> 11:27.900
And this, which is similar, showed up about the same time.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.200
Well, this one looks like it disappeared here.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.040
Could be, yeah.

11:35.040 --> 11:43.760
But it could be also that this restio and Cyanotes powoli are all similar.

11:44.220 --> 11:54.740
Males of Cyanotes powoli have some secondary sex characteristic on the wings that makes them easy to identify.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.660
But the females of all the species.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.800
But restio completely disappeared.

11:59.800 --> 12:16.800
And I know it was true restio because the guy who did the Mona revision, monograph on Cyanotes, designated one of my Cold Canyon specimens as a paratype.

12:18.800 --> 12:23.600
So, and I think they all feed on oaks.

12:23.600 --> 12:28.180
All of those three species.

12:28.340 --> 12:31.060
I mentioned Cyanotes, but there's a lot of Cyanotes.

12:31.940 --> 12:36.300
So, do you think that this dropping off could just be misidentification?

12:37.080 --> 12:49.300
I think it's possible that once I recognized powoli as a common species, and didn't dissect as many of them,

12:49.300 --> 12:54.960
I started calling more of them Johnstoni, or powoli, unless they were males.

12:55.560 --> 13:01.360
So, females is kind of a crapshoot as to whether I identified them correctly.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.140
But male, powoli.

13:03.140 --> 13:10.320
So, we should probably collapse powoli and johnstoni and call them either or?

13:10.760 --> 13:16.120
Are there any of the other Cyanotes that we should include in that lumped category?

13:16.120 --> 13:23.740
Well, I don't know whether your intention is to lump them for the purposes of analysis.

13:24.060 --> 13:27.180
Yeah, so it would be like, if we can't...

13:27.180 --> 13:28.580
But I kind of think that's a bad idea.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.040
Because the phenology may be very different.

13:32.140 --> 13:36.280
But in this case, since they all feed on oaks, that could be real.

13:36.420 --> 13:44.440
But it could be that there's a phenomenon going on where one outcompetes the others on oaks during some years.

13:44.440 --> 13:44.760
Okay.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.500
See, and there's the danger if you lump them together.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.420
Yeah, okay.

13:50.680 --> 13:54.280
But that's an opinion, and, you know, ultimately the decisions are yours.

13:54.960 --> 14:00.260
Okay, so do you think that any of these other Cyanotes could be, like, you...

14:00.260 --> 14:01.100
Confused with it?

14:01.280 --> 14:01.460
Yeah.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.560
There are other species which I haven't listed, but have...

14:04.560 --> 14:06.280
There's one called Petalumansus.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.380
There's one Occidentalis.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.040
There's some other ones that are very similar to it.

14:12.180 --> 14:12.340
Okay.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.820
If you want, you can look at the pictures on MPG and just say California.

14:17.820 --> 14:24.640
And look to see which species are identical to one another and which ones are in our area.

14:24.640 --> 14:32.340
And then, if you want, you can download the monograph and see which ones are oak feeders.

14:32.900 --> 14:38.260
But it doesn't really matter because when you collect them on the sheet, if they look like other species,

14:38.260 --> 14:44.220
their whole plant is irrelevant, if you might confuse them with one another.

14:48.800 --> 14:58.380
But Restia looks more like Johnstidae than either of them look like Palolai.

14:58.380 --> 15:08.960
But Jerry wrote in his book that Palolai is the most common species on oaks.

15:09.940 --> 15:14.760
But I think that was based upon the sites that he collected.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.380
Oh, Bellis is a...

15:20.500 --> 15:22.720
Well, let's skip it for a minute because here's Palolai.

15:22.720 --> 15:28.640
And you can see Palolai went from nothing to frequent.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.240
And that could be...

15:30.240 --> 15:31.420
You did that in Davis, too.

15:32.420 --> 15:32.720
Yeah.

15:34.880 --> 15:40.420
But I didn't get the similar species in Davis before I started getting Palolai.

15:40.780 --> 15:43.000
And Palolai is there very common.

15:43.620 --> 15:47.960
You know, there's that species I'm calling Galachia number two in Davis.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.840
And I have lots and lots of records.

15:50.840 --> 15:55.000
And now I'm beginning to lean towards that that's a Kayanodes.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.380
But I could be wrong.

15:58.760 --> 16:10.880
And, you know, what I need to do if it is Kayanodes is check to see whether it's one of these species that vanished

16:10.880 --> 16:15.280
because I forgot how to recognize it.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.820
So here's Palolai and going back to a Bellis.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.520
I think a Bellis is a Ceanothus feeder.

16:24.040 --> 16:30.680
It's a small one, drab, brown.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
Very few distinguishing features.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.520
So I dissected a number of them.

16:37.760 --> 16:47.220
And there's another species which only differs in small details of the genitalia.

16:47.320 --> 16:54.700
But I could see them clear enough to know that the small ones here that I dissected were all this one species.

16:54.700 --> 17:00.120
So here's Rustio.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.040
I'm surprised that there's that many late records.

17:05.040 --> 17:09.940
Okay, I'm going to stop us.

17:09.940 --> 17:39.920
I'm going to stop us.
