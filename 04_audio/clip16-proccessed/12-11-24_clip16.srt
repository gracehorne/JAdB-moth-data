1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:11,460
I always like separates, preferable to electronic, you know, because I never can find anything that I store as an electronic file.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,620
Yeah, yeah, it's a, that amount of information, that organization of it is something that most of us struggle with.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:32,740
I databased all of them before, but now when you buy the suite of office programs, they no longer provide the database.

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:45,380
So I'm in the process of trying to convert what databases I still have to Lotus, one, two, three, Excel files.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,420
God, I'm stuck in the past.

6
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,100
Technology moves faster than I do.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,820
Me too.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,780
You too.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,820
It won't be long before we're all Luddites.

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,060
Buckeletric Albertiola I discussed at Davis.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,320
It's probably Albertiata, but there's many other species that look almost identical to it.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,380
Anyway, I did get a few in the text. I'll bring them in.

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
Just, I just made up some way.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Powell said that there is another species on oak that's similar to Alberti yellow.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,380
But I think I have that one as buccolatrix number such and such in my backyard.

16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:44,320
The ones that I call buccolatrix number one or two or three in my yard are different than the one, two, and three at Cold Canyon.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:02:03,000
So it's interesting to me that we have both buccolatrix ceanothiella and separabilis here because what I was calling separabilis is ceanothiella.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
It was misidentification, and I gave you a correction.

19
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,680
But when I look here and here, these are the same.

20
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,340
So that's why.

21
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,020
That's why.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,700
It's just a duplicate.

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,060
To replace separabilis with ceanothiella in your, for both, I think there's one Davis record.

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,200
They're both kind of a white, tiny white moth with black markings, but they're very different from one another once you see the pictures.

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:40,440
But I didn't have the pictures until recently, and I knew separabilis, which is on coyote bush, from the coast, and I assume that's what we had.

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,400
But, you know, ceanothus is everywhere, so.

27
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,400
Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah, it's ornamental.

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,040
So that's a discrepancy there.

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,740
We'll fix it.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:03,380
And the rest of these buccolatrix are ones that I just assigned a number to.

32
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:17,840
The one that I call buccolatrix tawny or something turned out to be a tishereid, and I think they've all been changed, but I can't say that with certainty.

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,880
Bucolatrix have what they call eye caps, and that's expanded scales at the base of antennae over the eyes.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah, I love those so much.

35
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,900
They look like little puppies.

36
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:37,220
And tishereids do not, and that's why I was always suspicious about that so-called tawny albertio.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,300
Where are we?

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
So, her favorite word.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,980
Bucolatrix, you name it, yeah.

40
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,020
Puppy.

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,200
She just wakes up all morning, she says, puppy, puppy, puppy.

42
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,880
Yesterday, she called a bird a puppy.

43
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,040
My daughter's learning new words.

44
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,340
That's so cute.

45
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,100
The chaleptilia species slash species bee is probably more than one species.

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:17,060
And these are all kind of, chaleptilia in general is an enormous genus found in many, maybe in every hemisphere of the world.

47
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:43,820
And they're leaf miners that later make, most of which later make like a cone-shaped shelter on the same food plant in which they finish feeding, make their cocoon and pupa, and then emerge.

48
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:54,260
And they stand on, with their forelegs stiffened and their tails sitting back.

49
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,980
So, they're very easy to recognize on the sheet, even though they're tiny, longs.

50
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,400
Species bee are all the ones that are kind of a, yeah, that's the posture.

51
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,220
They look like tiger beetles.

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,960
The way they sit.

53
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,180
No, I don't know.

54
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,920
It may be that most of these things that have kind of a peculiar posture or eye spots and everything are thought to be mimicking spiders.

55
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,060
Interesting.

56
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,620
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,500
I see that.

58
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,180
I mean, the legs look a lot like spiders.

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,980
Other times, it's because they want to look twig-like.

60
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,900
So, I don't know.

61
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,080
The ones that I call bee are like this.

62
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,400
They're kind of brown here.

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,640
And then these little tick marks along the leading edge of the wing.

64
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,240
That's a funny-looking moth.

65
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,020
This is what, Wagner particularly liked these when he was in magic school.

66
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,140
I think it's like a little tripod.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,260
I like it, too.

68
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,540
Yeah.

69
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,280
So, I recorded a number of the ones that look like that as this.

70
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,280
And a couple of species were distinct and recorded by name or as some other thing.

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Like, there was a black one that we reared from ash only once.

72
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,440
And there's a name for one called, there's a name for a calyptelia on ash called Fraxinella, of course.

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,680
And that does not seem to be the species we have out here.

74
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:29,100
But it's an enormous genus with many undescribed species and many that are difficult to tell apart.

75
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:39,940
And very little available to the amateur to just differentiate them.

76
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,120
Do you think they're native?

77
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,060
Pardon me?

78
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you think they're native?

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,800
Probably, because they're leafminers.

80
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,180
Okay.

81
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,500
And most leafminers are highly specialized.

82
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,140
Mm-hmm.

83
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Okay.

84
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,300
Sometimes even to the species within a larger genus.

85
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,840
Mm-hmm.

86
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,940
Choradrina postacella.

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,720
This is a recent change in the genus.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,880
I don't know.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,860
It's a noctuit and I don't know much about the biology.

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,040
I don't think this is one that's covered in any of the fascicles on noctuits.

91
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,320
But it could be.

92
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,980
If it is, it's probably under the old generic name.

93
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,660
Oh, nice.

94
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,840
I just fell back.

95
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:33,860
I just fell back.

96
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,240
I don't know.

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Yeah.

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,680
We do have a shift in the...

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,020
Catacula ilia zoe.

100
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,120
Oh, okay.

101
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,860
Catacula ilia has...

102
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,060
Catacula are the underwing walls, you know, with the bright colors.

103
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,040
So it's thought to be aposematic.

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,720
You know, they flash this and cut it together.

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:04,480
Catacula ilia has red hindwings with the black loops in it.

106
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,360
But zoe, the western one, has yellow-orange hindwings.

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:23,040
And that makes it very similar to another species that is reported from this area.

108
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,940
And all the ones...

109
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:32,500
I didn't realize that there were these two very similar species and I didn't make any comparisons.

110
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,340
So it's possible that not all of these are this one species.

111
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,800
And the other species, I'd have to look at them to see what the name of it is.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,040
But like Shapiro and a number of other people have reported seeing this to me from time to...

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,960
The other species from time to time.

114
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,920
And I've always wondered whether they think that ilia always has red hindwings and it's a misidentification.

115
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,080
But the other one seems to be out here.

116
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,060
Directly.

117
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,900
Catacula is very popular.

118
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,100
See how it has a red hindwing there?

119
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,140
Yeah, it's a handsome wall.

120
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,700
But that's not the case out here.

121
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,120
Okay.

122
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,620
But the pattern of the forewings is different than the pattern of the other one.

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,380
It's different, but not startlingly different.

124
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,940
Houseplant? Native? Non-native?

125
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
I think most Catacula are native.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,320
And I think all of them feed on trees and shrubs.

127
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,020
And I don't know how host-specific they are.

128
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,040
Popular with collectors.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes.

130
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:53,320
Variliana is the more common species of Catacula with a red hindwing.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
It's a smaller one.

132
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:06,180
I'm surprised some of the other species didn't show up in sufficient abundance to make the list.

133
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,780
Often, you know, they're very strong flyers.

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,120
And often what happens is they come in, hit the sheet, they fly off, never to return.

135
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,080
And I think that could be the case with a lot of fast-flying moths.

136
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:34,640
And, you know, it doesn't make me upset because often they come back later, but not always.

137
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,020
Cyanotes brownella.

138
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Cyanotes is a chelikea.

139
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,660
Another one with the wings flat across the back of the body.

140
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,860
And it's known to be on lupins.

141
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,260
And I don't know what other food plants.

142
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,240
I never reared it myself, but it's one of the more common ones at Cold Canyon.

143
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
But I've never seen it at Davis.

144
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,960
Yep, yep, I see it.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,560
Cyanotes johnstidae.

146
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,200
There was another species that looks very much like this called Cyanotes restio.

147
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,000
And it kind of disappeared.

148
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,900
And this, which is similar, showed up about the same time.

149
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
Well, this one looks like it disappeared here.

150
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,040
Could be, yeah.

151
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,760
But it could be also that this restio and Cyanotes powoli are all similar.

152
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:54,740
Males of Cyanotes powoli have some secondary sex characteristic on the wings that makes them easy to identify.

153
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,660
But the females of all the species.

154
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,800
But restio completely disappeared.

155
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:16,800
And I know it was true restio because the guy who did the Mona revision, monograph on Cyanotes, designated one of my Cold Canyon specimens as a paratype.

156
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
So, and I think they all feed on oaks.

157
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,180
All of those three species.

158
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,060
I mentioned Cyanotes, but there's a lot of Cyanotes.

159
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,300
So, do you think that this dropping off could just be misidentification?

160
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:49,300
I think it's possible that once I recognized powoli as a common species, and didn't dissect as many of them,

161
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,960
I started calling more of them Johnstoni, or powoli, unless they were males.

162
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,360
So, females is kind of a crapshoot as to whether I identified them correctly.

163
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,140
But male, powoli.

164
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,320
So, we should probably collapse powoli and johnstoni and call them either or?

165
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,120
Are there any of the other Cyanotes that we should include in that lumped category?

166
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:23,740
Well, I don't know whether your intention is to lump them for the purposes of analysis.

167
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah, so it would be like, if we can't...

168
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,580
But I kind of think that's a bad idea.

169
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,040
Because the phenology may be very different.

170
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,280
But in this case, since they all feed on oaks, that could be real.

171
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:44,440
But it could be that there's a phenomenon going on where one outcompetes the others on oaks during some years.

172
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,760
Okay.

173
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,500
See, and there's the danger if you lump them together.

174
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,420
Yeah, okay.

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,280
But that's an opinion, and, you know, ultimately the decisions are yours.

176
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,260
Okay, so do you think that any of these other Cyanotes could be, like, you...

177
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,100
Confused with it?

178
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,460
Yeah.

179
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,560
There are other species which I haven't listed, but have...

180
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,280
There's one called Petalumansus.

181
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,380
There's one Occidentalis.

182
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,040
There's some other ones that are very similar to it.

183
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,340
Okay.

184
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,820
If you want, you can look at the pictures on MPG and just say California.

185
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,640
And look to see which species are identical to one another and which ones are in our area.

186
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:32,340
And then, if you want, you can download the monograph and see which ones are oak feeders.

187
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,260
But it doesn't really matter because when you collect them on the sheet, if they look like other species,

188
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,220
their whole plant is irrelevant, if you might confuse them with one another.

189
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,380
But Restia looks more like Johnstidae than either of them look like Palolai.

190
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:08,960
But Jerry wrote in his book that Palolai is the most common species on oaks.

191
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,760
But I think that was based upon the sites that he collected.

192
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,380
Oh, Bellis is a...

193
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,720
Well, let's skip it for a minute because here's Palolai.

194
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,640
And you can see Palolai went from nothing to frequent.

195
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,240
And that could be...

196
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,420
You did that in Davis, too.

197
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah.

198
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,420
But I didn't get the similar species in Davis before I started getting Palolai.

199
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,000
And Palolai is there very common.

200
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,960
You know, there's that species I'm calling Galachia number two in Davis.

201
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,840
And I have lots and lots of records.

202
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,000
And now I'm beginning to lean towards that that's a Kayanodes.

203
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,380
But I could be wrong.

204
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:10,880
And, you know, what I need to do if it is Kayanodes is check to see whether it's one of these species that vanished

205
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,280
because I forgot how to recognize it.

206
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,820
So here's Palolai and going back to a Bellis.

207
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,520
I think a Bellis is a Ceanothus feeder.

208
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,680
It's a small one, drab, brown.

209
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Very few distinguishing features.

210
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,520
So I dissected a number of them.

211
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:47,220
And there's another species which only differs in small details of the genitalia.

212
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,700
But I could see them clear enough to know that the small ones here that I dissected were all this one species.

213
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,120
So here's Rustio.

214
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm surprised that there's that many late records.

215
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,940
Okay, I'm going to stop us.

216
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm going to stop us.
