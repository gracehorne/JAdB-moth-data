1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
worried about the recording not working because it's so precious it's not working it is working

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,780
yeah yeah we're catching all of it i'm just tell you a species b there's two

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:18,960
named species non-determinata and i can't remember the other one

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,040
that wagner gave me the names for and there's one of each one from cold canyon one from my

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,180
backyard they both look very similar and they both look like what i'm calling calyptelia species b

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,300
so i suggest that you include non-determinata and the one from

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,960
let's see i might have that and the one from

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:54,700
and the other one as species b which is probably

9
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,060
two or more species

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:04,000
negundella is the other one

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,360
and that's negundella is the one as a record from davis and non-determinata is a record from cold

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,800
canyon

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:21,180
and wagner gave me names but he gave me a name in the past that made no sense because it was a

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,480
moth from florida or something so

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,300
you know he travels all over the place and sometimes forgets where he saw things

16
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,100
it's easy to put a name on things it's hard to put the right name on things

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,640
okay cameraria whislosinia there may be earlier specimens of this this feeds on

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,040
quercus whislosinia surprise which is valley live oak

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,500
and i may not have recorded all the early specimens

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,240
and it could be more than one species because

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,140
many of the cameraria species are very similar to one another

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,040
but the one that looks like at a cold canyon is on

23
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:24,100
quercus lobata or whatever and that isn't in davis so i think they're probably this is

24
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:32,200
probably one species and probably whislosinia but i've not dissected it it's tiny moth and

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:44,960
it's a demanding dissection caragina montana i think um there's one species that kind of resembles

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,880
it but i think they're all the same and there's two discrete generations per year

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,740
so i feel pretty good about that but

28
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:06,960
um caragina and there's species near it proxenus and spodoptera exigua seem to fluctuate in abundance

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:15,800
considerably from year to year and so the probability of collecting them probably increases when they're

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:23,680
having a big year and that may be real calcela ifitalis

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,660
feeds and

32
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,800
mud

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,260
wasps nests

34
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,860
oh interesting

35
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,880
and one year i had leaky sprinkler system and had a lot of mud

36
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,820
and that year i got a bunch of bud wasps nests under the ease to my house and i think they

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,680
may get in and feed on them after their

38
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,900
i don't know whether they feed on the larvae or feed on the debris that's left behind

39
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:00,780
but that could account for this abundance of them was the year my sprinkler system was leaking

40
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,300
interesting

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:12,940
kyanoti's okrio strigella feeds on sorrel i think

42
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:22,860
mm-hmm and uh it just shows up in low numbers and some years i get it some years not

43
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:31,420
but i do sometimes leave my porch light on and some i think i've seen it on my porch light

44
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,140
more often than i've seen it in my backyard

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:48,220
kyanoti's paloli um fees on oaks and i may have confused it there's one record of restio from early in the year and

46
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,140
males are easy to identify they have

47
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,600
a sex

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
linked

49
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,540
character

50
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,200
that you can't miss but the females

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,060
are hard to differentiate

52
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,560
from another species

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,120
and

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,280
folker heinrich who collects erin davis

55
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,480
has been calling them

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,980
occidentalis but i think his

57
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,360
i think that's erroneous okay

58
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,320
kyanoti's trichostola

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,040
um

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,400
it seems to overwinter as adults

61
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,380
um

62
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,500
and so you

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,940
if i weren't wasn't collecting earlier in the year i may have missed a lot of them

64
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,220
or late in the year

65
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,840
um

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,860
but

67
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,940
the fresh specimens seem to come out in the middle of the year so i guess it goes into

68
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,780
reproductive diaposism

69
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,820
and

70
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:59,680
i think it feeds on oaks but other things again there's a monograph on kyanoti's and the food plants of many of these are known

71
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,780
it looks like it's maybe declining in stubs and increasing in davis which is the first time i've seen that

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:17,960
could be because you know the oaks got hammered by the fires in cold canyon

73
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,880
it's a dark one

74
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,600
once you learn to recognize it it's easy to recognize but

75
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,980
it's hard to learn to recognize it

76
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,900
it doesn't you know it's kind of

77
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
nondescript but very consistent

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,620
so

79
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:53,620
copta trichimedia striata don't know much about it um i recorded this as a

80
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,640
buccolatrix

81
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,460
um

82
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,420
at both sites for a while and then realized it wasn't a buccolatrix i was always suspicious of it because

83
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,640
it was lacking one of the characters that buccolatrix has

84
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:18,200
what are we talking about copta trichimedia striata or similar species

85
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,420
and i'm pretty sure it's all one species but which species i don't know

86
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,200
so you confused it with

87
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,820
i thought it was a buccolatrix species

88
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,380
okay

89
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,660
so do you think in those early years not collecting it is

90
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,020
it would have been recorded as buccolatrix species one or two

91
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,100
i'm not sure which one i think species one at one locality and species two at the other

92
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,180
but i did make an effort to change all the records on all the data

93
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,780
on all of the spreadsheets

94
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,300
custa convexus centra strigaria

95
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,580
wait oh hold on one second so you corrected

96
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,180
you corrected the data these i think are all correct and all entered

97
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,160
so you think you really didn't see it in the very early years or you think that that's

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,280
well i may not have seen it

99
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,920
when i turned 65 which would have been 2010

100
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,620
um i was called in for driver's license

101
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,720
so i went to the optometrist and got glasses because i knew

102
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,540
i was going to flunk the

103
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:32,160
and all of a sudden small moths appeared at my sheet once again

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,440
so i don't think that i was as good at collecting small moths

105
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,060
in those few years prior to 2010

106
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,080
okay we'll deal with these grace i think we're just going to have to have like low

107
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,800
confident species models and higher confidence that sort of thing

108
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
yeah okay

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,680
um sorry i could we just go over these three again

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:03,140
coliophora sacramenta is a white coliophora it's one of the few that's very different from the others

111
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,160
and um

112
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:14,320
it has a i dissected a lot of the coliophora because i had a collection

113
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,520
of illustrations of the genitalia of almost all of the name species of which there are hundreds

114
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:30,520
and most of them didn't match anything but this one does seem to be a good match for sacramenta

115
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,260
and it's a white one so it's very distinctive

116
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,860
so every specimen that i collected was of a white coliophora was recorded as sacramenta

117
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,760
and we talked about peritana

118
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,620
so this is you think this is a real pattern where you just haven't seen it

119
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,200
i haven't seen any in recent years

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,520
so it could be that whatever it was feeding on

121
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:00,000
removed or it could be a parasite thing

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,660
uh do you so do we go over this essentially

123
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,880
i think we did but not on record so maybe if we can

124
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,380
oh yeah coliophora are external leaf miners if that makes it

125
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,180
uh-huh yeah

126
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,160
they make a um shelter

127
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,420
and there's a feeding tube as a feeding tube you know like if you have closed moths in your house

128
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,100
they make that little feeding shelter that they carry around

129
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,840
well they have a mobile shelter that's made from whatever they're feeding on

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,860
and groups of them with similar genitalia have similar feeding shelters

131
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,560
so some are kind of pistol shaped

132
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,440
and some are short tubes

133
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,620
some are long tubes

134
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,000
some are tapering tubes

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,680
and so on

136
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,220
and um

137
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,140
most leaf miners crash from time to time due to parasitism

138
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,920
so i don't know whether coleophora also crashes due to parasitism

139
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,140
or not but that might explain why this has disappeared

140
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,860
and then it takes a while to build up again

141
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,680
hey no

142
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,640
i mean

143
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,580
coleophora species b is the most common one around here

144
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,140
and i've been meaning to compare this to

145
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,340
a species that was introduced for control of

146
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,760
russian thistle

147
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,100
tumbleweed

148
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,440
is that what mario started

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,380
because that wasn't in the

150
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,440
that wasn't in the book of genitalia

151
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,960
no maybe

152
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,520
i think it's a different thistle

153
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,120
yeah

154
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,100
but this one

155
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,500
was in enormous numbers and seems to be in decline

156
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,120
recently

157
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,700
and if it is the one on tumbleweed

158
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,400
there's not as much tumbleweed around davis anymore

159
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,460
and whether it feeds on other um plants in the same family or not i don't know but

160
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:57,680
this is probably most coleophora are probably host specific or

161
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,700
narrowly um

162
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,040
what do they call it

163
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,520
oligo

164
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,700
i can't remember the terminology

165
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,360
oligophagus

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,100
yeah

167
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,640
i think

168
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,560
oh the technical terms that i don't use anymore

169
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
i never know how to say them either because i read them

170
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,020
yeah

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,640
not only that they redefine the term all the time and i can't keep up with it

172
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,820
costa convexo sensus sagaria getting back to that

173
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,720
i probably confused it with ortho nema obstepata in the early years

174
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,920
and they're somewhat difficult to tell apart

175
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,860
um

176
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:43,540
there are many that are clearly one or clearly the others but others are kind of difficult to tell apart

177
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,640
but it looks like in these early years you found them really rarely

178
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,620
you think that's real

179
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,700
but again this is one that a lot of records are early and late too so

180
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,600
mm-hmm

181
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,560
john would you just would you mind um going over the clepsis peritona again just for the recording

182
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,520
clepsis peritona again

183
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,400
just for the recording

184
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,860
okay

185
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,840
clepsis peritona is

186
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,100
polyphagus

187
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,380
feeds on low growing plants

188
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:27,440
and in the back corner i took out the lawn in a section of my backyard

189
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,160
and for a while i was

190
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,740
growing tomatoes which never bore fruit

191
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,780
and a number of garlic which never divided into cloves and a number of other things

192
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,680
so i kind of abandoned urban farmer

193
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,680
and it's gotten weedy and it's gotten overrun by this thimbleberry

194
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,580
and so i think that's what it's feeding on my yard and maybe that's why it's become common

195
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,580
but also there's a lot of late records for it

196
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:09,580
like it's the most common species in my yard in late October and early November

197
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:17,080
i mean i've been getting them the last few nights and sometimes multiples

198
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,480
where everything else is

199
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
very occasionally and

200
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
just one or two

201
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,180
got it

202
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,580
yeah

203
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,480
thank you

204
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:37,480
um maybe if we get through all of the seas we could take a break because we are all the time

205
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,380
i'm willing to stay as long as you would like if you're okay staying but it's

206
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
i have to go do you have to go

207
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
um

208
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,380
we have writing group but i can skip some of it probably

209
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
and you can keep recording

210
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
after your break and

211
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,380
maybe you and john can even if it's possible find another time this week to try and keep going

212
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,380
yeah and you can use our phone to call africa if you want

213
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,280
well she's going to use her own phone so

214
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
um

215
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
yeah let's finish out the seas

216
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
okay i'm at city of latiferiana

217
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
that's the filbert moth

218
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
and

219
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,280
here it probably feeds mainly in acorns

220
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
oh cute

221
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
and

222
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,280
i don't seem to get as many as greg does and greg has

223
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,280
oaks in his yard and i don't so that could explain it but it shows up throughout the year

224
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,180
and

225
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,180
i don't know whether it's in decline or not but

226
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,180
all i can say is greg records it much more often in a much bigger numbers than i do so

227
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
i think because i don't have oaks around

228
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,080
it's in decline in both habitats

229
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
pardon me

230
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,080
it's in decline in uh stebs too probably the fire thing

231
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
oh

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
yeah could be

233
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
um

234
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
i don't know what other

235
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:16,980
well it's called the filbert moth so obviously it gets in other kind of nuts and kernels and so forth

236
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,980
so i don't know what the full range of its host species is

237
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,880
city of pominella is

238
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
the

239
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
codling moth

240
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
and i don't think

241
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
you know this is a pest species and

242
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,780
and

243
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,780
the numbers vary from year to year in my yard and i

244
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
it's

245
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,780
didn't seem to be very common this year and

246
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,780
uh

247
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
this suggests a kind i

248
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,780
i don't think i've ever seen it at

249
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
um

250
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
cold canyon

251
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,480
i don't think i have one record for it

252
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,880
no you don't

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,280
so

254
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
it's a pest species

255
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,280
it's an introduced pest species

256
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,480
and it seems to be

257
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,080
closely associated with orchard crops

258
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,280
diastictus fracturalis feeds on grasses

259
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,680
presumably

260
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,780
and

261
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,480
so here's a case where there's one that seems to be increasing

262
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,780
in

263
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,080
abundance

264
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,780
whereas those two agriphalus species

265
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,280
which are also sod moths are

266
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,780
in decline so

267
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,280
it could be that one is replacing the other

268
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,280
you know because the introduced lawn moth which we don't see at cold canyon

269
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,380
has

270
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,980
pretty much displaced the native

271
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,380
uh

272
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,880
lawn moth or sod moth

273
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,780
do we want to

274
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,280
finish up with the diagrammas before you guys take a break

275
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,880
diagram

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,580
diagramia california area is

277
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
uh

278
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,680
feeds on conifer maybe more than one species

279
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,680
this is one even though there was a recent

280
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
monograph on

281
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,780
this

282
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,280
group of geometric moths

283
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,380
um

284
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,980
this was one section

285
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,780
that wasn't satisfactorily

286
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,980
resolved

287
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,280
it's somewhat variable

288
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,780
and i've been calling

289
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,980
uh oh

290
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
i just

291
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,380
i'm talking about the wrong one

292
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,180
california area i think is

293
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,480
on the

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
and

295
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,180
um

296
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,680
i'd have to look up what the food plant is

297
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
this is not the conifer one that's

298
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,580
multiple species

299
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,380
but it could be that at cold canyon

300
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,480
the small ones have been recorded

301
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,880
as

302
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,180
delictata

303
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,680
is that one in there

304
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,380
okay

305
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,280
i think i started recording it later

306
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,780
um

307
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,080
and

308
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,780
i did some dissections

309
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,980
i did some dissections of these

310
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,580
to determine that we have it

311
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,980
and

312
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,280
i only had a few records of this

313
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,080
and

314
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,780
muscariata

315
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,880
in the early years and both of them

316
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,680
have

317
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,980
increased in numbers

318
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,680
you think that's real

319
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,180
yeah

320
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,680
in the habitat

321
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,080
okay

322
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,680
i mean not only has the occurrences

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,880
increased but the numbers have increased

324
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,780
yeah it's interesting like

325
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
for

326
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,980
muscataria

327
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,580
muscariata

328
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,880
yeah

329
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
yeah muscariata

330
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,880
it looks like it went up a lot

331
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,480
like

332
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
maybe

333
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,380
2015

334
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,080
yeah

335
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,580
2016

336
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,080
and then

337
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,980
it's a really nice curve here

338
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,080
one of them

339
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,780
is known to feed on

340
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,580
lotus

341
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,180
and the other one

342
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,880
i can't remember now

343
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,880
i'm surprised that i can remember any of this to tell you the truth

344
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
yeah

345
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,180
it's incredible

346
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,880
you have a lot in your brain

347
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,380
yeah

348
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,480
diagramia

349
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,580
aerorata

350
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,580
looks very similar to

351
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,280
diagramia

352
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,780
neptaria

353
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
and

354
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
i think i

355
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,480
i did some dissections

356
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,360
and i think that i am

357
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,520
correctly identifying them all

358
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,840
but

359
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,920
mistakes could have been made

360
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,080
and neither one of them

361
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,360
aerorata seems to be the

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,060
more common one in my yard

363
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,760
and i don't know what the situation is

364
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,260
with neptaria

365
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,460
i'm not sure that they're calling it neptaria

366
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,760
that's still anymore

367
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,020
maybe plamolata

368
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,460
plamolata feeds on willow

369
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,500
so plamolata and

370
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,760
neptaria are both in your data set

371
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,460
do you think that they are distinct

372
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,100
no

373
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,680
plamolata i used to call something else

374
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,080
but i can't remember the name

375
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,680
but we have the other one here

376
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:55,920
and

377
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,480
what's

378
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
what's the other one neptaria

379
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,380
i get neptaria in my yard

380
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,540
but not as often as

381
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,320
aerorata

382
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,780
and it's

383
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,980
i guess it didn't make this

384
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,340
aerorata is in

385
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,080
yeah

386
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
it didn't

387
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,180
it didn't make the charts

388
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,480
oh

389
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,520
yeah it didn't make the charts

390
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,320
so i don't have

391
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,000
so do you think that

392
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,600
aerorata and neptaria

393
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,980
and plamolata

394
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,180
do you think that we should lump them

395
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,060
you think they're distinct

396
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,460
plamolata is very distinct from the other two

397
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,340
but aerorata and neptaria

398
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,860
are somewhat similar

399
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,900
and i've been

400
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
i did some dissections

401
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,720
and then i

402
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,780
after dissecting a number

403
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,620
where there were

404
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,660
seemed to be differences

405
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,140
which worked

406
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,400
i started

407
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
sorting them

408
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,020
on the basis

409
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,120
okay

410
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,900
of similarity

411
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,680
to dissected specimens

412
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,520
but when i look at

413
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,720
illustrations online

414
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,580
um

415
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,080
they don't necessarily agree

416
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,480
with

417
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,340
the way i'm sorting them

418
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,620
but the ones online

419
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,820
haven't been dissected

420
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,100
so

421
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,120
they could be

422
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,920
misidentified

423
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
well i'm

424
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
i'm trusting you

425
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,780
john

426
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,460
i think we should lump those

427
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,220
there were a lot of errors

428
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,120
uh you know

429
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,100
or in the early days

430
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,540
of moth photographers group

431
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,060
and they've been

432
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,260
getting straightened out

433
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
but now we have

434
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,200
i naturalists

435
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,020
with all of these

436
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,600
amateur

437
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,320
lepidopterists

438
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
posting pictures

439
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,880
of things

440
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,900
and it's

441
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,220
you know

442
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,640
it's good that we get

443
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,220
the records

444
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,020
but it's bad

445
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,720
that we get

446
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,880
unsubstantiated one

447
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,020
and

448
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,140
you can go in there

449
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,900
and identify them

450
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,080
and make them research grade

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,360
do you do that ever

452
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
well

453
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,740
um

454
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,720
some people have

455
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,960
but i don't post things

456
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,880
on i naturalist

457
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,400
oh god

458
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,060
that's a shame

459
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,140
grace

460
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,220
before i forget

461
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,100
grace

462
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,140
i do think that

463
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,500
um

464
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,440
we're gonna have to go back

465
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,760
to the original data set

466
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,960
and recapture

467
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,220
um

468
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,920
like for instance

469
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,420
iraida didn't make it

470
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,600
into that data set

471
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,980
but

472
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,500
because it doesn't have

473
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,700
no iraida did

474
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,020
neptaria didn't make it

475
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,600
in davis

476
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,860
oh okay

477
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,100
right

478
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,820
i thought it would have

479
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,620
had enough records

480
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,200
but i guess i didn't

481
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,080
so we'll have to go back

482
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,920
and rescue those

483
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
if we're gonna lump them

484
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
do you see what i'm saying

485
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,400
okay so we're

486
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,500
we're lumping

487
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,760
iraida and

488
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,560
neptaria

489
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,200
together

490
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,320
i think so

491
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,820
okay

492
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,280
i don't know that it would

493
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
change things very much

494
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,000
but

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
and

496
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,780
it probably won't

497
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,180
do you see what i'm saying

498
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,480
about the original data set

499
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,420
mm-hmm

500
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
okay

501
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
well we'll decide what to do

502
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,620
with all of these

503
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,300
we'll just like

504
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,100
uh

505
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,020
come up with strategies

506
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,180
and run them by john

507
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,000
um

508
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
okay i have to run

509
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,840
this is so

510
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,420
well you know

511
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,760
one time run through

512
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
may not be enough

513
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,560
the data
